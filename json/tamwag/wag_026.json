The Union convened annual delegates' assemblies, offered a low-cost health and dental insurance plan for freelancers, instituted a committee structure, and produced materials to assist their membership such as a model book contract, a survey of New England publications and a checklist of questions for writers to use when bidding on jobs.  Most significantly, the Union began to win contracts with periodicals, such as \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eMother Jones\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eColumbia Journalism Review\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eIn These Times\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eLos Angeles Weekly\u003c/span\u003e.
