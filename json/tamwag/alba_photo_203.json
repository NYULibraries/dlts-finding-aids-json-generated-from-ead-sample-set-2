There are also a few shots of naval vessels on the coast of North Africa and a few images of snowy mountains.  The many shots of Nationalist troops, Spanish officials, and individuals in German uniform suggest that the photographs might have been taken by a German visitor, touring Spain toward the end of, or just after, the Civil War. The slides were the property of Eric Muller, a  professional photographer from Lynn, MA, who got them from a returning U.S. serviceman who had served in Europe in World War II."
