He left the Stockton School District to seek employment elsewhere and eventually obtained a position at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Years later, after his retirement and return to California, he filed a claim for unpaid wages.  In 1980, Cerney's claim was rejected as were those of other non-signers of the Levering oath."

On October 3, 1950, however, the State Legislature enacted the Levering Act (California Government Code section 3100-3109.)  This act created an additional oath that all public employees were required to sign, including the following statement:  \"And I do further swear (or affirm) that I do not advocate, nor am I a member of any party or organization, political or otherwise, that now advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means; that within the five years immediately preceding the taking of this oath (or affirmation) I have not been a member of any party or organization, political or otherwise, that advocated the overthrow of the Government of the  United States or the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means...\"  "

The Court found that \"the oath...is invalid because it bars persons from public employment for a type of association that may not be proscribed consistently with First Amendment rights.\"  After the overturn of Levering, a number of faculty who had been dismissed for refusing to take the oath, demanded reinstatement and reimbursement of lost salary and pension contributions."
