The files include photographs and administrative documents, such as event flyers, membership lists, and lists of book recommendations. The bulk of the collection consists of scanned pdfs of the organization's newsletter, Tir na n-Og. The newsletters include organizational information, like upcoming events, elections, and changes in leadership, as well as songs, poems, and announcements about Irish cultural activities in the area. Many newsletters include reflections from students who visited Ireland through exchange programs and information about schools named after Irish or Irish American people.",
