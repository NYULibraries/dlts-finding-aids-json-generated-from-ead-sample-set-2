Two days after the bombing of Iraq began, on March 22, 2003, UFPJ mobilized more than 300,000 people for a protest march down Broadway in New York City, which in successive years would be a major protest day for the UFPJ.  Its first National Assembly took place in June of 2003, coordinating actions against President George W. Bush's war policies and solidifying UFPJ's organizational structure. The Assembly met again in 2005, 2007, and 2009, organizing its anti-war and other campaigns."
