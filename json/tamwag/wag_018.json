New York City native Peter McGuire helped to found the national Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners in 1881. In 1898, Charles Johnson Sr. organized and was treasurer of the local chapter, which consisted primarily of dockbuilders. Known as a Nordic local, its original members descended from Scandinavian immigrants."

The 1920s, which saw a period of great growth for the building industry, were followed by the stock market crash of 1929 and a decline in membership. Full recovery from the Great Depression did not occur until World War II. Postwar prosperity brought growth in collective bargaining, and the national organization's membership grew to 700,000 by 1946. Many women joined the union at this time. "

Critics of organized labor subsequently passed \"right-to-work\" laws, trying to re-establish open shops. In spite of new legal battles, the Brotherhood continued to grow as New York construction flourished. Union carpenters received substantial pensions and fringe benefits. However, anti-union sentiments increased nationwide, spawning a Congressional investigation into racketeering in American trade unions, including the Brotherhood. The Landrum-Griffin Act passed in 1959, requiring greater disclosure of union activities."

The 1990s saw rising corruption, increased federal oversight, nonunion construction, and formation of breakaway groups. In 2011, national union officials dissolved Local 1456 and merged it with another carpenters' unit."
