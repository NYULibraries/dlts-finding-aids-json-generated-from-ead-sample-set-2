AFTRA advocates on legislative and public policy issues that directly affect members' wages and working conditions. This includes lobbying and support for such issues as ownership consolidation in the broadcast industry, Equal Employment Opportunity laws and regulations, copyright and performance rights issues, \"non-compete\" restrictions, OSHA and local safety regulations, and more. AFTRA also represents artists and journalists in judicial proceedings, often as amicus, and before the U.S. Copyright Office. In 2012, AFTRA merged with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) to form SAGAFTRA."

The union was established in 1998 and negotiated their first contract with NYU in 2002. In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board reversed the Brown University decision, declaring private universities are not required to bargain with graduate employees and leading to NYU not negotiating a new contract. Over the next years, GSOC continued the fight for recognition at NYU, and currently gathering signatures to get NYU to negotiate a contract restoring healthcare benefits. The website contains information about the union and its Polytechnic Institute affiliate (SET-UAW), campaigns, news, and event listings."

In 1944 the school moved to Bensalem Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The school closed in 1957. This website is an informational website."
