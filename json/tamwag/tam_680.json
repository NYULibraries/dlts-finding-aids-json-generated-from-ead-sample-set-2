Born in Manhattan, a graduate of City College and the Brooklyn Law School, Popper was a founding partner of the New York law firm Wolf, Popper, Ross, Wolf \u0026 Jones. In 1945, Popper served as a consultant at the 1945 United Nations San Francisco Conference, and in 1946 acted as an observer for the American Bar Association at the Nuremberg trials. Popper served as executive secretary of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), as vice president of the Consular Law Society, a member of the American Society of International Law, and co-chairman of the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy. As an attorney Popper defended several prominent figures accused of Communist affiliations, including Dalton Trumbo and John Howard Lawson of the ''Hollywood Ten.\" In later years he represented the family of slain Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) civil rights worker Andrew Goodman, participated in nuclear disarmament campaigns, founded the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and offered support for the Palestinian Liberation Organization on behalf of the New York City Chapter of the NLG."

The bulk of the collection relates to Popper's position as executive secretary of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), including published reports, copies of the \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eLawyers Guild Review\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eGuild Practitioner\u003c/span\u003e, drafts of articles and legal briefs, interview transcripts, and correspondence describing his direction of the Guild's political orientation. Popper's defense of the \"Hollywood Ten\" before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) is reflected in publications produced by the NLG; and his 1961 conviction for contempt of Congress and its 1962 reversal is represented in newspaper clippings, memoranda, official court records and declassified FBI documents. Also included in the collection are publications and photographs related to Popper's involvement in the 1945 United Nations San Francisco Conference; publications related to his co-chairmanship of the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy; and his representation of many accused of Communist affiliations or sympathies, including Dalton Trumbo and Paul Robeson. Later records, including newspaper clippings, correspondence, and court records, detail Popper's representation of the family of slain Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE) civil rights worker Andrew Goodman; his opposition to the United States' involvement in the Contra War in Nicaragua; and his 1984 amicus observation of photographer Fred Sparks' bequest to the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Included in the correspondence is a letter to Popper from Shirley Graham Du Bois regarding the overthrow of Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah."
