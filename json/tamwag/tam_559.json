Subjects of the photographs include Dr. Chung at age 16, wedding photos, and Dr. Chung later in her life. Many photographs are of the various groups and societies which she was a part of during her college years, including her sorority (circa 1947-48), the Chinese Student Club (circa 1947-48), and Sigma Sigma Phi (circa 1947-48). There are also two large panorama photos from Alpha Lambda banquets in 1947 and 1949. Many of the photographs are annotated on the back, and the annotations contain descriptive information about events and individuals in the images. Color scans of Dr. Chung's scrapbook from the University of Minnesota (circa 1947-48) are also included, as is a hand-made poster for a radio program which Dr. Chung appeared on as a guest."
