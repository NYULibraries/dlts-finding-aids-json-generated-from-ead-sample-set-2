She was an active participant in the Save Our Union Movement in Local 1199 during the 1980s that challenged the administration of president Doris Turner. (In 1983, she was fired from her nursing job, allegedly in retaliation for her union activism.) The Save Our Union movement was composed of progressive union activists, including Communists, who held that the Turner administration had abandoned the radical politics, militant stance on labor issues, and inter-racial/ethnic solidarity that many felt had often been in evidence under the leadership of Local 1199's founding president, Leon Davis, and that Turner's administration had also stifled dissent within the union. After the 1989 election of Dennis Rivera as president of Local 1199, Albert became a staff organizer. In the years after the 1989 election, Local 1199 first became the National Union of Hospital and Nursing Home Employees, Local 1199 Drug \u0026 Hospital Union (New York, N.Y.), and in 1998, Service Employees International Union. Local 1199 (New York, N.Y.). Albert has also worked with the South African National Education, Health, and Allied Workers Union in 1996 and 1997 and was a founder of an anti-war caucus following the September 11th attacks, called 1199ers for Peace and Justice, which later joined US Labor Against War. Presently (2010) she works as a National Organizer for National Nurses United."

After the 1989 election of Dennis Rivera as president of Local 1199, Albert became a staff organizer. This unprocessed collection documents the struggle within Local 1199 (then part of the RWDSU, e.g., the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union), and Albert's role therein, as well as subsequent activity through the years in which 1199 first became the National Union of Hospital and Nursing Home Employees, Local 1199 Drug \u0026 Hospital Union (New York, N.Y.), and in 1998, Service Employees International Union. Local 1199 (New York, N.Y.). The collection contains correspondence, memorandums, reports, circulars, and other various internal documents; fliers, leaflets, clippings, pamphlets and other printed ephemera. There is also one audiocassette, containing a 1984 interview conducted by Dennis Rivera with David White, an 1199 officer who charged that fraud had altered the outcome of the Local's 1984 elections.",
