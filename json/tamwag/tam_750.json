Correspondence, notes, and notebooks also document Hamlin's career as an arts professor at Washington University in St. Louis and Ohio State University, where his employment was terminated after he refused to answer questions before the Ohio House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). His relations with the House Un-American Activities Committee are documented in correspondence, newspaper clippings, and collected court transcripts."
