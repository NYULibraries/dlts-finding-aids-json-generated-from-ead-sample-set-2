His work as an artist and labor organizer is documented in original artwork, exhibition flyers, correspondence, sketchbooks, notes, newspaper clippings on exhibitions, pamphlets containing his illustrations, and documentation of his involvement in labor organizing. Correspondence, notes, and notebooks also document Hamlin's career as an arts professor at Washington University in St. Louis and Ohio State University, where his employment was terminated after he refused to answer questions before the Ohio House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). His relations with the House Un-American Activities Committee are documented in correspondence, newspaper clippings, and collected court transcripts."
