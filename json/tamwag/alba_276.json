Also included is a scrapbook of newspaper clippings dating from 1939 concerning a documentary film she worked on with her then-husband, Herbert Kline, titled \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eCrisis\u003c/span\u003e. Kline, a Spanish Civil War volunteer in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, was a photographer and filmmaker, and the couple worked on several projects together after their time in Spain. Materials include some photographs documenting the Spanish Civil War, photographic prints taken by Harvan for a film written by John Steinbeck titled \"A Forgotten Village\" and a copy of the book based on that film.  Included are correspondence concerning the potential publication of Harvan's manuscript \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eCailin\u003c/span\u003e, and correspondence with individuals at Camp Intermission at Saranac Lake, New York concerning her manuscript \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eShades of Mollie Maguire\u003c/span\u003e. One of her later married names was Chellas, and notes in a file indicate that she was at one time married to novelist Meyer Levin."
