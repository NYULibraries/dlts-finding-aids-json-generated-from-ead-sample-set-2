Correspondence in the collections primarily consists of letters written to his sister Dorothy during World War II, which discuss the fighting Germany and leave time he spent in Paris, France. Waitzman also sent his sister clippings from \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eStars and Stripes\u003c/span\u003e, the daily newspaper of U.S. armed forces in the European Theater operations.
