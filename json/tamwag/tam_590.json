Some of the correspondence is not directed to Franke, but amongst other parties and organizations. Several of the organizations and people represented are Amnesty International, Ford Foundation, and Committee to Protect Journalists. Much of Franke's correspondence relates to information and updates on the East Timor situation, advocacy campaigns, TAPOL funding, and requests for TAPOL and related publications. This series consists substantially of correspondence pertaining to human rights activist and TAPOL UK cofounder Carmel Budiardjo - her imprisonment, campaigns for her release, and her 1976 speaking tour in the U.S.\n \nThis series also contains a number of letters addressed to the U.S. Congress, the Department of State and other governmental agencies related to the situation in East Timor, Indonesian political prisoners, and U.S. aid and involvement. Some of the aforementioned letters are form letters from advocacy groups. There are also several letters to the editor of major news media outlets concerned with their coverage of the occupation of East Timor."

It includes some of Franke's articles and manuscripts, as well as his reviews of other works on the subject. The manuscripts include a few early drafts of Franke's pamphlet entitled \"East Timor: The Hidden War,\" issued by the East Timor Defense Committee in 1976. It details a brief history of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, the U.S military involvement in the conflict, Fretilin and the East Timorese' struggle for independence, and calls to action. The early drafts of this work contain inscription, including layout notes, and original photographs. There are also two copies of the final published pamphlet. Some of Franke's writings are accompanied with research material. This series also contains Franke's conference material from the Permanent People's Tribunal Session on East Timor which was held in Lisbon, Portugal on June 19-21, 1981. An oversized poster from this conference material was separated and placed in Series VII."

The articles and clippings reflect the news coverage of the Indonesian occupation and other writings on the history, politics, and culture of Indonesia, East Timor, and other Asian and Pacific Island nations. The publications and reports, as well as the subject files, and correspondence, details the advocacy work of organizations such as TAPOL USA and UK, East Timor Defense Committee, and Amnesty International. Many of the organizations are US, UK, and Australia based. Much of the correspondence reflects Franke's work with TAPOL and other activist or advocacy groups. The collection also contains a substantial number UN and US. Congressional records, predominantly statements and testimonies. A small number of materials reflect liberation struggles of Western Sahara, Asian and Pacific Island nations and peoples. There is a small number of photographic and graphic materials, and memorabilia related to the work and causes of TAPOL and other political and human rights groups."
