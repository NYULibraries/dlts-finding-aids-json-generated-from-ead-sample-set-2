Throughout its existence, SOS worked nationwide to educate and mobilize young people for reproductive rights and freedom. SOS, along with the National Organization for Women (NOW) and Women's Health Action Mobilization (WHAM!), organized a boycott of Domino's Pizza. Domino's CEO Tom Monaghan was a major contributor to right-to-life-organizations and resigned as a result of the boycott. SOS also held the yearly National Student Conference on Reproductive Rights, a field organizer program, and a training task force on reproductive rights. SOS reorganized in 1992 and broadened its agenda to include AIDS/HIV awareness, date rape, and full access to affordable healthcare. The organization was active until 1995, when its records came to the Tamiment Library."
