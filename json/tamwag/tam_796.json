He held the position of President of the Workmen's Benefit Fund for 20 years, until his retirement in 1976. The Conrad Woelfel Papers (dated 1924-2008) includes scrapbooks, correspondence, newspaper articles, and photographs documenting Woelfel's labor union organizing in New York City from the 1930s through the 1970s, particularly his tenure as President of the Workman's Benefit Fund; and his engagement with the German American community, with an emphasis on his involvement with the German-American Congress for Democracy. The collection documents 20th century labor organizing, particularly in the greater New York City area and with an emphasis on the experiences of German and Jewish immigrants. The collection also shows the ways in which German immigrants navigated concepts of American patriotism during World War II, and how they built solidarity, community, and support for one another. The collection also contains a small amount of materials documenting the Recreation Farm Society collected by Woelfel's daughter Helen Krumpf, including financial records and photographic prints.",

The collection documents 20th century labor organizing, particularly in the greater New York City area and with an emphasis on the experiences of German and Jewish immigrants. The collection also shows the ways in which German immigrants navigated concepts of American patriotism during World War II, and how they built solidarity, community, and support for one another. The collection also contains a small amount of materials documenting the Recreation Farm Society collected by Woelfel's daughter Helen Krumpf, including financial records and photographic prints."
