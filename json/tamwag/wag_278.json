Newsletters and flyers touch on many topics related to union activities, while materials from 1971 in particular document a Communications Workers of America (CWA) strike against the Bell System. Several flyers also document union election campaigns in which Newman ran for positions within Local 1101, including President and Job Steward. Other materials include CWA labor agreements and buttons from Local 1101 elections."

The collection includes court documents regarding the Communications Workers of America, District One, AFL-CIO vs. NYNEX and N.Y.

The accretion also includes memorandums to CWA members about the NYNEX strike, industry reports, as well as news clippings, bulletins, pamphlets, and flyers related to the CWA. A small amount of materials dated prior to the 1989 strike feature literature on telecommunications, technology, labor, and unions."
