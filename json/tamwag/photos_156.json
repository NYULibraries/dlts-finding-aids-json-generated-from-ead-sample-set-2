A few negatives are from visits to Hyde Park. Some negatives and photographs are housed in annotated paper sleeves or envelopes; the annotations may provide descriptions of individuals, places, or events in the images. There are also two promotional flyers or pamphlets for the camp and an advertisement for \"Paul Robeson Day.\""
