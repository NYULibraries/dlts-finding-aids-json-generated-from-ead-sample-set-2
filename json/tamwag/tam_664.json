He attended public schools and became the first person from his Brooklyn high school to be admitted to Harvard University.  He graduated from Harvard in 1934, and obtained a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1937.  After graduation from law school he worked for a labor law firm in New York City for, whose clients included the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.  In 1941, he took a position in Washington, D.C., with the enforcement division of the wartime Office of Price Administration (OPA).  At OPA, he met his future wife, Jessica Mitford Romilly (known as Decca Mitford, radical and rebellious daughter from a famously eccentric and conservative family of British aristocrats), who was also working at the agency.  In 1943 Treuhaft left the OPA and moved to the West Coast to work for the War Labor Board's San Francisco office and to join Mitford, who had also taken a job in San Francisco.  They married soon after their arrival to the Bay Area.\n \nIn 1945, Treuhaft joined the law firm of Gladstein, Grossman, Sawyer \u0026 Edises.  At Gladstein he represented West Coast labor unions expelled from the CIO as a result of accusations that they were Communist-led or dominated.  A few years later he and Bertram Edises established their own firm.  They became well-known as civil rights attorneys when they successfully defended, Jerry Newson, an 18-year-old African American man, against a framed-up murder charge.  Treuhaft also acted as counsel for the East Bay Civil Rights Congress from 1949 to 1956, advocating for clients suffering racial discrimination and he brought pioneering police brutality suits against the Oakland Police department.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Treuhaft, Walker \u0026 Burnstein represented clients in civil rights cases (as well as handling more general law, such as wills and divorces, for clients among the African American and progressive communities in the area); they also became well-known for representing New Left organizations and activists.  Treuhaft acted as counsel for the Free Speech Movement, representing the more than 700 students arrested at the University of California at Berkeley during a two-day sit-in in 1964.  He himself was also arrested during the sit-in, at the direction of then- Assistant District Attorney of Alameda County, Edwin Meese, who later became Attorney General during the Reagan presidency.  In addition, Treuhaft and his firm represented anti-Vietnam War protesters, Black Panther Party, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and University of California students and town residents arrested during the struggle over People's Park in Berkeley.  Treuhaft's expansive vision of civil liberties included child custody cases in which he defended clients whose parental rights being challenged on the basis of their cultural lifestyles. \n \nAs part of his lifelong concern for the rights and welfare of ordinary citizens, Treuhaft became interested in consumer rights and protections.  In 1962 he co-wrote a handbook for California lawyers on debtors' rights.   When he became aware of deceptive practices by funeral homes he helped to found the Bay Area Funeral Society to serve as a model for simpler and less expensive funerals, and took a year's leave of absence from his law practice to research the topic more deeply.  He also assisted his wife with writing \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eThe American Way of Death\u003c/span\u003e, an expose on the funeral industry based on his research.  Published in 1963, the \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eThe American Way of Death \u003c/span\u003ebecame an enormous (and to the Treuhafts, entirely unexpected) success, a bestselling book, and made Mitford--already a published writer--famous as a muckraking journalist, known for her special blend of investigative journalism with political satire.  As a consequence of the publicity surrounding the \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eAmerican Way of Death\u003c/span\u003e Treuhaft was appointed by California Governor Jerry Brown as a public member to the California State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers (much to the consternation of funeral directors throughout the country).

Treuhaft (1912-2001) a radical left-wing attorney prominent in progressive and New Left politics in the San Francisco Bay Area, was known for his work as a civil rights and civil liberties attorney as well as representing New Left organizations and individuals, such as the Free Speech Movement.  He was perhaps equally well-known for his wife, muckraking writer Jessica Mitford, radical and rebellious daughter of a family of conservative British aristocrats and author of a best-selling expose of the funeral industry,\u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003e The American Way of Death\u003c/span\u003e, for which Treuhaft contributed the research.  Treuhaft and Mitford joined the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) in 1943 and remained members until 1958. Treuhaft provided legal representation for \"unfriendly\" witnesses subpoenaed by the U.S. House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC); he himself and Mitford were called to testify before the Committee in 1953, where they also failed to cooperate with the Committee by \"naming names.\"  As a consequence of this, and their other political activities Treuhaft and Mitford were constantly surveilled and frequently harassed by federal, state, and local government agencies.  The collection consists of of legal case files, business and personal correspondence,  internal memos, FOIA files, published and unpublished writings, newspaper clippings.",

Correspondence and receipts in the \"red-baiting\" folders (as they were originally labeled by Treuhaft or his office staff) document extensively his efforts to defend himself from attempts to dismiss him from his job at the Office of Price Adminstration on political grounds.  These same files contain numerous newspaper clippings, leaflets and publications report on the course of much of his political activity, albeit often in a biased or distorted manner, including accusations and attacks in the right-wing press and a scurrilous newsletter from a local Communist Party group; even an insurance claim that documenting what may have be a politically motivated deliberate damage to Treuhaft's automobile."

Because Treuhaft and Mitford often had, or developed close relationships with business correspondents (they were often friends or became friends)  a considerable amount of the correspondence mixes both personal and business matters."

(If not otherwise noted, attorneys are indicated by their initials on their original folders: RET for Treuhaft, DOB for Doris Walker, MB for Malcolm Burnstein).  Clients--defendants, plaintiffs, or targets of grand jury investigations--are mainly progressive or leftwing political organizations and individuals associated with these organizations or individuals involved in cases springing from political events.  Organizations and individuals associated with them include the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton; the Free Speech Movement (from the beginning, with the more than 700 arrested, through the appeals process), Mario Savio and Treuhaft himself; Civil Action Day Committee (clients arrested in a civil disobedience action at a draft induction center to protest conscription); and \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eBerkeley Barb\u003c/span\u003e (newspaper), Robert Scheer, John Poland.  Briefs, statements and correspondence document Malcolm Burnstein's defense of eighteen members of the Black Panther Party arrested after its widely-publicized demonstration in front of and inside the California state capitol while armed with deliberately unconcealed rifles.  Documents from this file include handwritten statements from each of the defendants.  Files for Treuhaft clients arrested during the events of People's Park include what appear to be police surveillance photographs and audiotape obtained during the legal discovery process.  Case files for two child custody cases involving controversy over parents' lifestyle include the widely-publicized Mark Painter case.  Treuhaft also represented fellow Bay Area radical attorneys Faye Stender and Charles Garry (both in politically-associated contempt of court-related cases).   A small sample of workers' compensation cases  illustrate Treuhaft's work in this field, in which he specialized nearly exclusively during the last decade of his legal practice.",
