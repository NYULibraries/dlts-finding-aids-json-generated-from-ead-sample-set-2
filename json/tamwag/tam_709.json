Alger Hiss was a State Department official who was accused of Soviet espionage, and was eventually convicted of perjury in 1950. Interviews in the collection were recorded between 2001 and 2004 as part of an oral history project created by The Nation Institute following Hiss's death in 1996, and feature individuals who spent time with Hiss later in his life. Interviewees discuss their personal relationships with Hiss between the 1970s and 1990s, and focus on impressions of him during those years. Several interviewees were among a group of young volunteers who read books to Hiss when he began to lose his eyesight. Many interviews focus on how the interviewees' personal relationships with Hiss shaped their views about the charges against him.",

In this short interview Penny Blum talks about her social relationship with Alger Hiss and his first wife Priscilla. Much of the interview focuses on social engagements with Blum, her husband, and the Hiss family. She also talks about Hiss's political beliefs, and Priscilla Hiss's frustration about the lack of support her husband received from his powerful friends after he was released from prison.  Finally she discusses how their friendship ended over a political disagreement between Hiss and her husband."

In this interview Victor Brudney shares personal anecdotes about his friendship with Alger Hiss, who he met in 1965.

He also talks about serving as a witness on Hiss's behalf during his application to be readmitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1974. Brudney shares several personal stories about his social relationship with Hiss, and also discusses Hiss's continued interest in clearing his name, including his attempt to reach out to Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov, and his interest in the Venona papers."

In this interview Lawrence Buttenwieser talks about his recollections of Alger Hiss and his memories surrounding the Hiss trials. His mother, Helen Buttenwieser, was an attorney for Hiss during his trials. The bulk of the interview focuses on Buttenwieser's impressions of Hiss as a person, his political beliefs, and his intellectual interests. It ends with speculation about how Hiss will be remembered by history."

In this lengthy interview, Anne Geismar reflects on her social relationship with Alger Hiss and shares general opinions about his character. Geismar begins the interview by talking about her own life and shares a story about meeting her husband Max Geismar in 1930. She also talks about her early career working at \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eArt Digest\u003c/span\u003e. She describes meeting Hiss at a dinner party shortly after he was released from prison, and talks about how she saw his trials as symbolic of the political atmosphere that was dominated by anti-communism. Much of the interview focuses on Geismar's general impressions of Hiss, his friendship with her husband, and Hiss's literary interests."

In this interview Jack Gelber talks about his acquaintance with Alger Hiss and his personal research into the Hiss trials.

In the interview, Gelber does not touch on specific events, but rather discusses his general impressions about Hiss's personality and memory toward the end of his life."

In this two-part interview Agnese Haury talks about working at the United Nations (UN) and her friendship with Alger Hiss. Haury begins the interview with a discussion about her background, and the events that led her to begin working as an editor at the United Nations. She talks about working with Hiss during the early days of the UN, and discusses how staff at the UN viewed the Hiss trials. In the first interview she describes attending several of the trial proceedings, and talks generally about Hiss's initial reaction to the allegations. The second part of the interview focuses more on Hiss's personal relationships. She shares a story about taking Hiss's wife Priscilla and his son Tony to Lewisburg prison following his conviction, and discusses providing the family with financial support. She also talks at some length about Hiss and his brother Donald, and concludes the interview with a discussion about Hiss during the last years of his life."

In this lengthy three-part interview Tim Hobson talks about his relationship with his step-father Alger Hiss and his memories of the Whittaker Chambers allegations. In the first part Hobson talks about his mother Priscilla Hiss, his father Thayer Hobson, and his relationship with Alger Hiss. The first part of the interview also focuses on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, and Hobson's memories of the years in which Chambers claimed to be associated with the Hiss family. The second part of the interview largely focuses on Hiss's life after his conviction and his release from prison. Much of this section focuses on family dynamics between Hiss, his son Tony, and his second wife Isabel. The third part of the interview returns to Chambers's account of his relationship with Hiss and contains some more pointed questions about the degree to which his testimony conflicts with Hobson's memories."

In this interview Tim Horan talks about his friendship and business relationship with Alger Hiss. He explains that he met Hiss in 1960, when Hiss came to his office selling stationery. Much of the interview focuses on Horan's perception of Hiss as a person and his political beliefs. At the end of the interview Horan discusses Whittaker Chambers's accusations against Hiss and provides an assessment of Chambers's personality. Finally he talks about Hiss's decision not to have his step-son Tim Hobson testify on his behalf."

In this brief interview Alan Levine talks about his experience as a reader for Alger Hiss.  Levine explains that he volunteered to read for Hiss after reading his second autobiography, in which Hiss talked about performing the same service for Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes when his eyesight faded.  In this interview Levine shares several anecdotes about Hiss, speaking about his views on politics in the early 1990s, and Hiss's work as a court reporter at the Rosenberg case.  The interview closes with a discussion about the books Levine and Hiss read together and the other volunteers who read to him."

Lundquist describes meeting with Hiss in 1944 when he was working for the Visual Presentation Division of the OSS. He talks about Hiss's work at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and his role in leading several early United Nations meetings. The interview also touches on Lundquist's relationship with Hiss, who he describes as a mentor. Lundquist also talks about his opinion of Hiss's innocence and talks at length about typewriter forgery. He concludes the interview by talking about the 50th anniversary of the United Nations and Hiss's physical condition toward the end of his life."

In this interview Harry Magdoff talks about his friendship with Alger Hiss, who he met at a dinner party in the 1950s. Magdoff begins the interview by sharing a story about his acquaintance with Harry Dexter White, who was also named as a Communist by Whittaker Chambers. Magdoff also talks about accusations of communist espionage that he faced, and talks about how that experience built a mutual understanding between Hiss and himself. He also talks generally about his social relationship with Hiss, and shares his opinions about him as a person."

He explains that Hiss was a friend of his parents, and took an interest in Papachristou because he was a student at Harvard Law School. He talks about how he later started working for Hiss's lawyers on a petition to reopen his case. Papchristou reflects on Hiss's sense of history, and his political beliefs.

In this interview Gerard Piel talks about his acquaintance with Alger Hiss and his opinions about the Hiss-Chambers case. Piel begins the interview by explaining that he met Hiss through some mutual friends a short time after he had been released from prison. Piel, who was the publisher of the magazine \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eScientific American\u003c/span\u003e, talks briefly about Hiss's intellectual interests and political beliefs. He describes Hiss as taking a \"detached or historian's view of the world\" and portrays his view of his years in prison as equally reflective. The end of the interview focuses on Hiss's work at the United Nation, and includes a brief discussion about the character of Whittaker Chambers."

In this interview Corrine Rafferty and Dale Wiehoff talk about their experiences as readers for Alger Hiss. The interview begins with Rafferty explaining that she began reading to Hiss through the suggestion of her friend Karen Brudney, and later invited her husband Dale Wiehoff to meet Hiss in 1985. The interviewees explain how they later became frequent dinner guests of Hiss and his wife. Much of the interview focuses on their perceptions of Hiss's personality and his literary interests. Wiehoff shares an anecdote about Hiss's recollections about the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and they both talk about Hiss's continued hope that he would someday be proven to be innocent."

Reuben discusses his research on the Alger Hiss case and his acquaintance with Hiss.  Reuben explains that he met Hiss in 1954 when he began research on a book about the Hiss-Chambers case. They later served as co-plaintiffs in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking to gain access to files related to his case. Reuben spends much of the interview discussing his research into Hiss's trial and talking about his impression of Whittaker Chambers. Reuben also talks about interviewing Max Bedacht and Sender Garlin, who Chambers had mentioned in his testimony to the FBI, and talks about how their recollections correspond with Chambers's account. He also shares his opinions about Hiss's attorney Claude Cross."

In this interview Kenneth Simon talks about working on Alger Hiss's legal team during his first appeal. In the interview Simon explains how he came to work for the Hiss defense team after graduating law school in the 1940s. The bulk of the interview focuses on the various tactics lawyers on the Hiss legal team pursued, and some of the disagreements between attorneys on his team. He also briefly discusses the role of Helen Buttenweiser in the Hiss cases. Toward the end of the interview he talks about Hiss after he was released from prison, his work selling stationery, and reflects on how the experience changed him."

They talk about living down the street from Hiss and in East Hampton, which made it easy for them to visit as readers. The bulk of the interview focuses on Spinak and Scharf's friendship with Hiss and his wife Isabel, the help they would give them around the house, and the lasting impression Alger had on them."

She explains that she met Hiss in 1968 when she was working at the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, and Hiss came into the office to sell stationery. She later came to know him more closely in 1976 after the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, when she assisted him with the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ecoram nobis\u003c/span\u003e petition to overturn his conviction. She also talks about her friendship with his first wife Priscilla and his son Tony. The majority of the interview includes personal anecdotes including a story about Hiss befriending crime boss Frank Costello in prison, and another story about Hiss's relationship with Alan Weinstein, the author of \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePerjury: The Hiss–Chambers Case\u003c/span\u003e."

Train explains that he was recruited to read for Hiss sometime in the mid-1980s by their mutual friend Sally Belfrage. The interview focuses largely on Train's impressions of Hiss and his discussion of Hiss's reading interests. Train talks about his perception of Hiss as a very private person, and at the end of the interview he speculates about how history will remember him."

In this interview Robert von Mehren talks about his acquaintance with Alger Hiss and the Hiss trials. He begins by explaining that he first met Hiss in 1948 when Whitney Debevoise, whose legal firm represented Hiss, asked for assistance on the libel suit against Whittaker Chambers. Von Mehren talks about advising Hiss's lawyers on responding to subpoenas from the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Grand Jury in New York, and offers his perspectives on the mistakes he believes were made by Hiss and his legal team during the libel suit and subsequent perjury trials. Von Mehren also shares his opinions about the personalities of Whittaker Chambers and Hiss."

They talk about continued interest in Hiss's trials over the past decades, and discuss the research of Allen Weinstein, Victor Navasky, and John Lowenthal. They also talk about evidence related to the trials that came out over the years, citing Dimitri Volkoganov and the Venona papers. They also discuss the personality of Whittaker Chambers. The end of the interview focuses on their personal friendship with Hiss and the ways in which his life changed after the trials. They also talk generally about McCarthyism and the political climate contributed the investigation of Hiss."

They also feature discussions about Alger Hiss's trials and the continued analysis of the evidence against him. These discussions address topics including Whittaker Chambers's accusations, evidence introduced during the trials, the 1996 release of the Venona papers, Allen Weinstein's book \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePerjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case\u003c/span\u003e, and Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov."
