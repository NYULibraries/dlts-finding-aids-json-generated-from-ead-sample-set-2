In 1984 a second donation was made; this body of documents and papers from Flynn's earlier years and included the papers of her son, Fred Flynn. Photographs from these donations were established as a separate collection, the Elizabeth Gurley Flynn Photographs (PHOTOS 118). The accession number associated with these materials is 1964.003. Additionally, two black and white photographs found in repository have been added to this collection. The accession number associated with these images is NPA.2000.347. Forty five slides, donated by Rosalind Baxandall, were also added to this collection. The accession number associated with this gift is NPA.2001.036.

Raised by socialist and Irish nationalist parents, she gave her first speech at the age of fifteen. She became an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and while aiding the Western Federation of Miners was briefly married to Jack Jones, the father of her son Fred, born in 1910. During her involvement in the IWW's Lawrence, Massachusetts textile strike of 1912 she met and fell in love with anarchist organizer Carlo Tresca, with whom she lived for the next twelve years. In 1917 she founded and chaired the International Liberty Defense League (later the Workers Liberty Defense Union) until 1924, when the International Labor Defense was formed. She was also an officer of the Garland Fund, and a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). After the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927, Flynn fell seriously ill and spent nine years in Oregon where she lived with feminist activist Dr. Marie Equi. In 1936 Flynn returned to New York and joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), in short order becoming a member of its Central Committee, and later its Political Bureau, and finally Chair, 1961-1964. During these years she wrote a bi-weekly column \"Life of the Party\" for the \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eDaily Worker\u003c/span\u003e, wrote an autobiography, (variously, \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eI Speak My Own Piece\u003c/span\u003eand \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eThe Rebel Girl\u003c/span\u003e), ran for political office, attended international conferences, was expelled from the ACLU in 1940 for her Communist Party membership. In 1952, her leadership role with the CPUSA resulted in her trial under the Smith Act and in her conviction and imprisonment for 28 months in prison under the Smith Act. Upon her release, Flynn wrote a prison memoir, published as \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eThe Alderson Story\u003c/span\u003e. She died in Moscow in September, 1964."
