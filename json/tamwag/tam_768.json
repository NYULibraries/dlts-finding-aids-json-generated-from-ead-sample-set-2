Prior to this visit, Williamson had been a chemistry teacher in Oakland, California. Williamson was the first member of the delegation to return to the U.S. from China, and upon returning he had his passport revoked by the U.S. government and was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). While cooperative with the U.S. government throughout the process, Williamson was vocally critical of U.S. perceptions of China, maintaining that the right to travel and the right to free thought were essential American values in spite of anti-Communist U.S. foreign and domestic policies during the Cold War.
