Like many children of New Yorkers who worked in the garment industry, Reiss hoped to escape having to make a living in an economic sector beleaguered by difficult working conditions and low pay. After graduating from Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School in 1929, Reiss enrolled at New York University as a pre-dental major, intending to join the ranks of professionals by becoming a dentist. At the University he attended only night classes to allow him to work a garment-industry job during the day. By January of 1933, after four years, Reiss had managed to accrue two years of college credits. It was then that his father suffered a stroke that left him disabled; Reiss dropped out of school to help support his family and found full-time employment as a shipping clerk at a clothing factory in the men's garment district."

In 1938 he wed Helen Handwerger; two daughters, Jessie and Harriet, were born to them."

He received his first labor news assignment in 1947, when he was hired to shoot some photographs for the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eRWDSU Record\u003c/span\u003e, the newspaper of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Workers Union. Throughout his nearly thirty-year career, the RWDSU, as well as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the Transport Workers Union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union remained among Reiss's major clients, employing him regularly to document the activities of their organizations, although he also shot for dozens of other labor unions and locals."
