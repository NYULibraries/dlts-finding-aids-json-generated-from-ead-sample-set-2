Morgan Building.\n\nDoyle kept a camera in his tool kit and made a photographic record of aspects of the work which interested him, including new technology, difficult procedures, and near accidents. Many of the photographs depict the beams and girders that would form the buildings and the cranes and derricks needed to lift them into place. Doyle also took pictures of his friends and co-workers on the jobs. The collection documents the building construction processes of the period and the daily lives of union members.",
