Much of the copious original material performed at Tamiment found its way to the professional stage, Broadway, and television. The Playhouse was part of Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists and their families that opened in 1921. It began offering professional theatrical productions by the early 1930s, and closed after the season of 1960."
