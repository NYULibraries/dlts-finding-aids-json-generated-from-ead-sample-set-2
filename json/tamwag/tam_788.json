He worked as an illustrator for the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Tribune\u003c/span\u003e, and later contributed to left wing publications including \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe Masses\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe Liberator\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe Revolutionary Age\u003c/span\u003e. Gropper was also the staff cartoonist for \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eMorgen Freiheit\u003c/span\u003e, a Yiddish publication affiliated with the Communist Party, USA. Gropper's drawings for these publications frequently portrayed workers with compassion and critiqued powerful politicians or business owners. He also created multiple murals as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Although he prolifically contributed to communist publications, Gropper was not formally a member of the organization and declined specifying affiliations to political parties."
