He became president of the Local in 1964, a position he held during the Welfare Department strike of January 1965. With other members of the Local's Executive Board, along with the leaders of the Social Service Employees Union (SSEU), Viani spent 12 days in jail for defying the Condon-Wadlin law by refusing to order the membership back to work. In 1968 he left the local to become the assistant director of, District Council 37's Research and Negotiations section. He became its director in 1973. In 1986 he left DC 37 to become the Deputy Director of the Office of Collective Bargaining (OCB), an agency that was established as a direct result of that 1965 strike. He retired in December of 1992. Although retired he is still active as a labor negotiator and was one of the people brought in to help end the New York City transit strike of 2005."
