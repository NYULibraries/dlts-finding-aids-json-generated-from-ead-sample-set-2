At age sixteen he joined the Young Communist League and later became a member of the Communist Party. In the early 1930s he worked with groups agitating for labor reform and was soon appointed a full-time labor organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO)."

Upon the United States' entry into World War II in 1941, Warren fought off charges of \"suspected disloyalty\" to join the U. S. Army, and eventually participated in the D-Day invasion and in ground battles in both France and Germany."
