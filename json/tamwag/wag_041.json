The UHCMU survived the 1920s despite an open shop offensive, a decade-long depression in the cloth cap industry, and a bitter intra-union struggle between Communists and moderates for control of the union. Taking advantage of New Deal labor policies, the union conducted militant organizing drives during the Depression. The numbers of organized millinery workers mushroomed from 3,987 in 1929 to 12,647 in 1934. A spirit of cooperation characterized labor relations in the headwear industry during the 1930s and 1940s to protect the health and stability of the industry, including advertising campaigns, technological assistance to employers, loans to manufacturers. Nevertheless, both the industry and the union, highly susceptible to fashion trends, have gradually waned following World War II. In New York in 1985, there were approximately 3,000 hat and millinery workers. Ethnic composition of the work force, as in the other needle trades, has shifted from Eastern European to Hispanic and Caribbean. "
