The son of a Harvard graduate, Parker traveled to Europe in 1934, taking up temporary residence in Paris with his wife, Esther, before returning to the United States. In March of 1937, Parker sailed from New York on the Ile de France to join the International Brigades. Because of his fluency in French and familiarity with the country, Parker was first assigned to help American volunteers move from Paris to the Spanish border, to arrange care for injured soldiers at the American Hospital in Paris and to negotiate the release of jailed Brigaders. In July 1937, Parker finally got his wish and was transferred to Spain. He attended Officer Training School in Albacete, achieving the rank of Lieutenant. Well-educated as well as a committed Communist, Parker was soon appointed political commissar of the school, and later of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, where, among other responsibilities, he conducted trials of soldiers accused of indiscipline. In March 1938, Parker was killed along with battalion commander David Reiss and others by a direct hit of artillery fire on the battalion command post in Belchite."

Also included is a carbon copy of portions of Parker's diary, dating from when he joined the Brigades in Paris through his transfer to Spain. His concern with world affairs and his commitment to Communism is evident throughout the collection. His letters contain vivid, detailed accounts of life and politics in the Brigades. Also included are carbon copies of tributes to Parker after his death. Handwritten documents include letters from volunteers to third parties describing their experiences in the Brigades."
