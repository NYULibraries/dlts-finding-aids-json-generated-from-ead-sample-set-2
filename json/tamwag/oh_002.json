The purpose of this project was to expand the archive's documentation of radicalism and labor by recording the memories of veteran activists before they were lost. The founders of OHAL were working within the milieu of \"new social history\" and were intent on using the Oral History of the American Left to collect stories from groups often underrepresented in traditional historical narratives including rank and file activists, women, and ethnic minorities. The project founders, by their own admission, were a part of a revival of interest in folkloric community histories and captivated by the ability of the recorded interview to bring these stories to life. They also were cognizant of the interviewer's role in shaping an oral history, and the interviewers' own activism is also frequently on display. As such, decades later, the early interviews of the collection not only give insight into the experiences of activists from the 1910s-1960s, but illuminate the psychology of the Left during the Reagan era."

The New Jersey Historical Commission provided funding in 1978 to support interviews on radicalism in New Jersey between 1930 and 1960. Later, Ruth F. Prago developed the idea to start a radio series based on interviews held for the OHAL collection. Together with Pacifica Radio the project received a one-year grant from the New York State Council for the Humanities to conduct interviews with twenty-five women about radicalism during the 1930s. Radio producers used these interviews to create the radio series \"Grandma was an Activist,\" first broadcast in 1983. OHAL received major funding in 1982–1983 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This support enabled Paul Buhle to build a comprehensive collection of oral histories regarding ethnic-immigrant radicalism, its press, and fraternal organizations. The NEH grant also enabled OHAL to collect hundreds of hours of interviews made by filmmakers on American anarchism, the Hollywood blacklist, the Communist Party, the Columbia University student strike of 1968, and other subjects."

Also discussed are gender relations in the left and academy; the relationship between music, poetry, theatre, and beat culture and politics in Madison; and the importance of the Rathskeller bar in academic and radical life. Baxandall also discusses her studies in French and history, academic role models, challenging cultural norms, the beginnings of the women's movement in Madison, and the impact of her time at Madison on the rest of her life."

Prago, a member of the Oral History of the American Left staff, developed the idea for a radio series based on interviews to be conducted for the OHAL collection.

Radio producers Beth Friend and Charles Potter used these interviews to make a six-part radio series titled \"Grandma Was an Activist,\" first broadcast in 1983. One of the series interviewers, Bea Lemisch, and three of the women interviewed for the series, participated in a panel discussion at the 1984 Berkshire Conference on Women's History."

The Main Series (Series 1) is particularly sweeping in the topics that it documents, but a set of prominent topics emerge representing the interests of OHAL staff members in the early years of the collection. These include immigrant/ethnic radicalism, labor, women's history, radical newspapers, fraternal organizations, and student radicalism. The earliest interviews were done to collect the memories of men and women who could recall the 1910s-1920s. Later interviews document the effects of the Russian Revolution on the Left in the United States, the formation of social and cultural institutions by the \"New Immigrant\" groups, the history of socialism and anarchism, the relationship between the \"Old Left\" and \"New Left,\" and Communist activism in the United States. There is also an analysis of the regional development of Left movements in the United States.\n \nOHAL interviewed representative figures from the Jewish, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, African American, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Spanish Left. For many of these interviews, there is a focus on how ethnic identity and political identity interacted and how non-English-language presses and fraternal organizations preserved this identity in the United States. The cultural experiences of Yiddish-speaking Jews are particularly represented in this regard. Paul Buhle took a sizable amount of interviews related to the relationship between Yiddish-language literature and culture and Communist and socialist political organizations and newspapers."

The Johnson-Forest Tendency and CLR James receive particular attention. Other political parties/factions addressed include the the Socialist Party, Workers Party, Socialist Workers Party, and the American Labor Party. The CP's role in the period is examined in depth, both by members and opponents, especially during the 1930s. The interviews taken to support \"Grandma Was an Activist\" provide insight into the experiences of women activists during the period."

Organizations discussed in other interviews include the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Workmens' Circle, International Labor Defense, National Lawyers Guild, the Southern Negro Youth Congress, and the Yidisher Kultur Farband (YKUF), among many others.
