Following his early involvement in organizing labor, he was elected New York Municipal Court Judge on the Socialist ticket in 1917. Failing at re-election in 1927, he was appointed to Court of Domestic Relations by Mayor LaGuardia in 1934, retiring in 1955. Correspondence frequently relates to court cases and includes some appreciative letters from boys and parents of boys brought before him. Much correspondence is from admirers, some from ditractors; a smaller amount relates to Socialist affairs and includes some letters from friends such as Morris Hillquit, Girolamo Valenti, and A. I. Shiplacoff. Mss. contain addresses on socialism, and social and political issues. Includes some speeches delivered during his unsuccessful campaigns for political office, such as Municipal Court Justice (1927) and Congress (1930). Also ran for U.S. Senate (1920), Mayor (1921), and Governor (1930). Active in ORT (Organization for Rehabilitation through Training), a Jewish philanthropy. Typed pages of autobiographical writings, legal documents relating to court cases, and clippings on his career after 1927 are also found."
