He was among the founding members of several other communist organizations including the Revolutionary Union, the Revolutionary Communist Party, and the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters. He was involved in organizational activities in Minnesota, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Newark, and New York City. Bergman also spent more than two years in the People's Republic of China in the years leading up to the Cultural Revolution, and made many follow-up trips to the country in the 1970s and 1980s."

A large portion of these materials relate to Bergman's work in with the RCP and RU, and are composed of position papers, party building materials, study articles, bulletins, and Bergman's writings on political strategy. These materials also include records related to a split in the RCP that led to the creation of the RWH in 1979.Materials related to Bergman's work with the CPUSA include correspondence, drafts, and publications from the 1950s and 1960s. Among these materials are records related to the Party's trial against Bergman, in which he was charged with promoting ultra-left factionalism in his club. Other materials in the collection consist of drafts of Bergman's poetry and theatrical works, including a copy of his first book \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eContent and Form in Poetry\u003c/span\u003e. Bergman's poetry largely dates from the 1940s and 1950s and includes several works written under the pseudonym Sam Swing. The collection also contains materials related to Bergman's military service in the 1940s, and documents related to his travels to the People's Republic of China in the 1970s."
