He went on to join the faculty of New York University in 1927, remaining there as Chairman of the Philosophy Department until his retirement in 1969.

In 1956 he appealed to the Supreme Court and was reinstated based on a ruling that he had been denied due process of law. He was again suspended on charges that he had  made false statements under oath but, before the actual trial, he resigned and spent the rest of his life in the practice of psychoanalysis.
