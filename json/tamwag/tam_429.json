He went on to join the faculty of New York University in 1927, remaining there as Chairman of the Philosophy Department until his retirement in 1969. From 1973 until his death in 1989, he was a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University."

In 1956 he appealed to the Supreme Court and was reinstated based on a ruling that he had been denied due process of law. He was again suspended on charges that he had  made false statements under oath but, before the actual trial, he resigned and spent the rest of his life in the practice of psychoanalysis. (In 1957, Sidney Hook published \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eCommon Sense and the Fifth Amendment\u003c/span\u003e which discusses the implications of the Fifth Amendment in cases of teacher dismissal for alleged Communist activities.)
