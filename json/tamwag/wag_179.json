He was active in politics outside of his political involvement on behalf of SSEU, serving as a delegate to Wisconsin Democratic Conventions in the 1950s and 1960s."

A large potion of the papers focus on Local 371's legislative advocacy and its support of Local 420's Health and Hospitals Corporation strike. Christian and/or anti-Coummunist publications obtained by Knight through subscriptions and Local 371 correspondence also make up a significant part of the collection. To a lesser extent, there are also publications from a number of civil rights organizations."
