In September 1928, Kleinman formally joined the Communist Party, Section 2, and served as an organizer, committee member and delegate to local and regional meetings. Active in the labor movement, Kleinman was arrested several times for his participation in strikes between 1926 and 1930. Immediately before volunteering for combat in the Spanish Civil War, Kleinman was employed as a tailor at Miss Style Coat Company on West 38th Street, New York and became a member of Local 112 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU).

The collection is comprised of a group of eleven letters that Joseph Kleinman wrote to friends Morris, Pauline, and Demos (child) Eitzer and Morris and Nettie Srebnick between July 15, 1937 and June 28, 1938.  Kleinman, a committed leftist who was suffering after the recent death of his fiancée, enlisted to fight in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Republic. The letters, attempts to maintain connections to home and solicit news of mutual acquaintances, follow his journey from Paris to Albacete and Barcelona and document such subjects as soldiers' participation in Bastille Day celebrations in Paris, the bombing of Barcelona, Kleinman's hospitalization due to a wound to his right arm, his views on Nationalist General Francisco Franco, and his urgings to friends at home to work to amend the Neutrality Act of 1937. The Neutrality Act, recently expanded to encompass civil wars, imposed an arms embargo on belligerent countries and prohibited American citizens from traveling on belligerent vessels. Supporters of the Spanish Republic argued that the Act advantaged the Nationalist rebels, who continued to receive substantial military assistance from Italy and Nazi Germany."
