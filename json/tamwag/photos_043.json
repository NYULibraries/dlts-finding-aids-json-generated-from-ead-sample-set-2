Daughter of a Presbyterian minister, she graduated from Monmouth College (where she wrote for the college newspaper), a small private institution. Immediately upon graduation she became an official of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, where she honed her talents as an organizer. In 1898, Lewis left the WCTU to work for the woman suffrage movement full-time, working her way West on state suffrage referendums, ending in Oregon. In 1902, in California, she joined the Socialist Party of America (SP). Shortly after, she rose quickly to become a full-time national organizer for the SP. In 1903 she married Arthur Lewis, a well-known Socialist lecturer, and in 1909 she became the first woman to be elected to the Socialist Party's National Executive Committee. The following year she served as its delegate to the International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen."

When the Depression caused Labor World to fold, she managed the 1932 Socialist Party campaign in Salt Lake City, and as worked for the Party in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho. By now in her mid-sixties, and virtually penniless, she moved to New York City, where a small group of socialist functionaries might find support. In 1936 she left the Socialist Party and helped found the Social Democratic Party. In the last years of her life she worked in the library of the Socialist Party-associated Rand School of Social Science, organizing the papers of the movement to which she had devoted her life."

A handful of family photographs are included, but most are from Lewis' political life. Although the total number of images is small, some of aspects of Lewis' biography are reflected (albeit fragmentarily) in them. Highlights include: tintypes of Lewis as a child and young woman, and images of her mother, Mary A. Story; from the 1910s, snapshots of an audience listening to Lewis speak at an outdoor meeting in Lynn, Massachusetts, postcards of processions at the 8th International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen, 1910,, group photographs of Socialist Party members that include F.G.R. Gordon, J.G. P. Stokes, Rose Pastor Stokes, Victor Berger, and Clarence Darrow (all posed together) and women of Socialist Party in Minneapolis (including Lucy M. Van Lear, the wife of the Socialist mayor of that city, Tom Van Lear), and the exterior of a hall of the \"Arctic Brotherhood\" in Dawson (in the Yukon) where she spoke during her travels; from the 1920s, a group photograph of women (staff members?) at Socialist Party headquarters; from the 1930s, a hand-colored portrait that appears to be some sort of amalgam of a photograph and drawing. There are also pieces of literature (with photographic images of Lewis printed on them) from two of her campaigns for public office (both on the Socialist Party ticket)--one from her 1916 run in Alaska for United States Congress, and another for her 1934 race for California Lieutenant Governor."
