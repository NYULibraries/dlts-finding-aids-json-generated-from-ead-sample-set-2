From the beginning, Local 66 clashed with its CIO counterpart, the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians (FAECT). Disputes over jurisdiction and methods, followed by a disastrous FAECT strike in the late 1940's led to the demise of the FAECT in the 1950's. The leadership of J. Lawrence Raimist for 27 years as President (from 1940 - 1962) and then of Ed Meskin (in the 1970's) helped Local 66 to continue organizing in spite of changing technology and work location."
