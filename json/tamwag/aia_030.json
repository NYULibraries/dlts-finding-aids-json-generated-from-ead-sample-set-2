Brennan discusses his family, including the education and working life of his parents.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1973, settling in Boston, and establishing a painting and renovation business with his brother. He explains that they were able to establish this business despite not having visas or Green Cards and discusses their expansion of their business in the 1980s.  He explains the way in which he gained a Green Card and the expansion of his real estate investments after this change in his resident status. He describes the bars he owned in Boston, including the Brendan Behan Pub in Jamaica Plain and the Thirsty Scholar in Cambridge, and discusses the role of these bars in the Irish and Irish American culture in the Boston area.  Brennan also discusses his real estate investments in County Kildare, Ireland and the work ethic his parents instilled in him and his siblings."

While Burns was investigating recruits the NYPD came out with their Law Enforcement Assistance Program.  Burns took advantage of the program and completed a degree in Criminal Justice at Saint John's University, resuming a college career that he quit to join the Army Reserves. During this time Burns was also studying to be a sergeant and working full time.

Cardosi describes the situation of his birth in Ireland in 1957, his adoption by an American family in 1958, and his knowledge about these events.  He relates his knowledge about the Sean Ross Abbey, his experiences as an adopted child, and the fact that his background was something that was openly discussed in his family. He describes his parents and their backgrounds. He describes a trip to Sean Ross Abbey with his wife in the 1980s, in which they toured the facility, met some of the staff, and conducted research on the circumstances of his birth.  He discusses the movie Philomena, the discussion started by the movie in 2013 about mother and baby homes in Ireland, and his decision to engage in the discussion.  "

In a largely chronological manner, Cassidy starts by discussing his Brooklyn roots; his parents; his education; Vietnam; his battle with drugs and twenty-three month stay at Phoenix House; friendships with comedian George Carlin and musician Kenny Rankin; and the meaning of Irish identity. After starting off with a clear New York/East Coast focus, the narrative then shifts geographically to Cassidy's life in California and most particularly in San Francisco. Topics like his writing (his screenplay, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe Volunteer\u003c/span\u003e, was sold to Francis Ford Coppola), labor organizing, and his move into teaching are covered. Cassidy engages in a detailed discussion of language and slang, in the context of Irish American culture, with his long-time friend Peter Quinn, author of \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eBanished Children of Eve\u003c/span\u003e. Cassidy provides an insider's perspective on the day JFK was assassinated as a rookie journalist in the newsroom of the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/span\u003e. The interview concludes with Cassidy emphasizing the extent to which Irish American scholarship awaits thorough excavation, by contending that immense research potential sits like 'gold nuggets' on the ground."

Deevy describes her family and her childhood in Crettyard, County Laois, Ireland.  She recounts training as a nurse in North Wales, England in the 1950s, serving as a midwife in Dublin in the 1960s, and deciding to join the Little Sisters of the Assumption (LSA). She describes her vocation, her decision to join the LSA, and her work in the Ballymun neighborhood of Dublin.  She discusses her decision to leave Ireland for a year in 1988, her decision to pursue a master's degree in education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, and her work with the Irish immigrant community in the Boston area. She discusses her opinion of the importance of creating an inclusive organization in Boston for all immigrants and the importance of creating a safe place for Irish immigrants who may not identify with traditional Irish American organizations that existed in the late 1980s in Boston."

She had grown up on a small farm in Killarue, and she attended National School in Cavan until the age of eleven.  Her parents and had come back to Ireland in order to bring her back to the United States.  She has thought about her return to America at age eleven after spending nine years in Ireland.  Joan only knew life on the small farm on which she lived.  She felt that moving to New York was both exciting; however she has second guessed her parents' decision to bring her back to the United States.   She does not have regrets about returned when she did, as affirms that she has a wonderful life here.  She does; however, remember that her uncle wished that she could have stayed until she were grown up, as she brought happiness to the lives of two older people and a bachelor. She thinks perhaps she should have left as a seventeen or eighteen year old.  Joan admits that is was difficult reunite with her parents since she really did not know them.  She began to know her parents only after she was brought back from Ireland when she was eleven years old in April of 1948.  She describes her father as a quiet man who was dedicated to his family and his work.  Her mother was a talented cook who had received on the job training in her first years as an immigrant in Providence, Rhode Island.   "

It just would have been a matter of time as there would have been little room for her on the farm, and there were few jobs to be found in Ireland.  Since she did return at a young age; however, she had to adjust to American life.  She recalls the drastic change, \"From Killarue to Times Square, my goodness.\"  She attended St. Jean Baptiste High School on the Upper East Side where she admits that it was difficult to fit in at first.  The immigrant mentality focused on assimilation.  Joan remembers that she did not want to project an image of Irishness in school; rather, she wished to be seen as an American.  These feelings changed as she grew past her adolescence, and she wished to explore and promote her Irish culture.  "

When she was nineteen, Joan resumed Irish dancing under the direction of Peter and Cyril McNiff.  She became one of their ceili dancers, and she danced competitively for four years.  She describes her time she spent dancing as one of the greatest parts of her life—she danced because she enjoyed dancing, and so she could be around the friends she made in her ceili, including Andy McCann, Eva McManus, Peter McNiff, Cyril McNiff, Hannah O'Leary, Larry Reddigan, Peter Smith, Gerry Wallace, Lori Walsh, Mike Bergin Peggy Bergin, Edmund Brown, Joan Cass, Eugene Clancy, Pat Clancy, and Jimmy Erwin.  She described the ceili uniforms of her team as being quite simple—green skirts, white stockings, white shirt, and a black dance jacket.  She compares those more traditional outfits to many of the new styles used in Irish dancing today.  She very much approves of popular productions such as Riverdance because have brought Irish dancing into the mainstream; however, the outfits—wigs, outrageous colors, and fancy embroidery—really do not embody the spirit of the dance; rather they commercialize the Irish dancing.

In addition to dance, Joan also believed that attending Irish events as a family promoted the preservation of Irish culture.  Joan has practiced what she believes as the Dolan family has marched annually with the Gaelic League in the St. Patrick's Day Parade.

In her family history, Donovan includes the lives of her parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles who immigrated to the US. She describes her decision to move to the Ealing neighborhood of London, England to gain a license in registered nursing. She recounts meeting her husband in 1951 while at an Irish dance hall in Ealing. She discusses her many moves between Ireland and the US due to her husband's homesickness and how her nursing license allowed her to find employment in both countries."

She discusses the strong Irish community her parents were part of in Philadelphia during Duffy's childhood.  She discusses her and her husband's involvement in political organizations focused on Irish republican issues, particularly between the 1970s and 1990s. She recalls the riots in Northern Ireland in 1969 as being the event which spurred her and her husband to join the Derry Society of Philadelphia and later the Philadelphia Committee for Irish Freedom and Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID).  She also discusses her family's annual trips to County Derry and her memories of the announcement about the Good Friday Agreement in 1998."

The interview covers Monica Durkan's early childhood in the suburbs of Dublin, Ireland and her travels as Pan American World Airways flight attendant. She relates her many moves for her job as a flight attendant, including four years in San Francisco, California before traveling to London, England for 6 months in 1974. Durkan recalls her experiences of anti-irish sentiment after the Monaghan and Dublin bombings in 1974 while living in London. She describes meeting her husband, Frank Durkan, in 1975 in New York, his involvement with Irish American organizations, and his connections with activist Paul O'Dwyer. She describes the Irish American community's polarization over political history and the Irish Civil War causing rifts in the Irish community. She identifies the Irish Republican leanings of Irish immigrants compared to Irish Americans and how women are taking leading rolls in Irish politics."

Fanning's mother Frances Patricia Fanning never worked outside the home. Her mother was born in Cork because her parents, who had immigrated to Boston, had returned to Ireland to settle an estate."

Fanning also admits while reviewing his education choices that fear of being drafted into the Viet Nam War kept him in school.  In his final graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 , Fanning explains that he discovered his true passion while pursuing American studies and explored the connection between literature and history. Fanning wrote his dissertation on the work of Finley Peter Dunne which examined the Chicago Irish. Fanning also talks about his mentors John Kelleher, professor at Harvard, and Tom Brown at the University of Massachusetts, whose advice directed him toward Dunne."

Farrell describes her childhood on a farm in County Armagh, Ireland; the relationship between Catholic and Protestant people in her village in Armagh; and recounts her decision to immigrate to the United States in 1964.  She recounts her reasons for leaving Ireland, in particular the neglect of Catholic areas in Northern Ireland and her inability to get a good job as a Catholic. She discusses her membership in the American Congress for Irish Freedom (ACIF), her memories of Bernadette Devlin McAliskey and Sandy Boyer, and the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 1960s.  She discusses her involvement in the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), describes the beginning of the organization in New York, and recounts the many Irish American political organizations worked together in the 1970s. She also discusses the opinion of Irish Americans to the activities of the ACIF and NORAID, the experiences of her siblings who remained in Northern Ireland, and the importance of Irish music in Irish republican politics in the 1970s and 1980s."

O'Carroll at the Irish Pastoral Center in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts on April 11, 2016.  The interview covers Father Dan Finn's family and his experiences as a priest in Boston for over 35 years. Father Finn describes his family, his childhood and early education in Ireland, and his family's immigration to the United States in 1960s.  He describes his vocation and his religious education and training at Cardinal O'Connell Seminary in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, and later St. John's Seminary in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston. He describes the changes in the ethnic and cultural composition of the congregation at St. Mark's between the 1980s and the time of the interview, from largely Irish and Irish American to Vietnamese, Haitian, and Dominican.  He recounts his involvement in the immigration reform movement in Boston, starting in 1987 with his introduction to the situation of undocumented Irish immigrants with Sister Veronica Dobson and his involvement with the Irish Immigration Reform Movement. Father Finn also discusses his involvement in the Greater Boston Interfaith Organisation, his focus on building connections in the community, and his participation in the Gaelic Athletic Association."

The interview includes Donal Gormley's early life in County Leitrim, Ireland and his mother's strong Irish republicanism. He recalls his eldest sister's help getting him settled in the Bronx, New York in 1967. He recounts how his military service in the Vietnam War sharpened his sympathies for the civil rights struggles in Ireland and the United States. He describes the Irish American apathy for Irish civil rights and compares it to his observation of unions in New York supporting Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID) fundraisers. He discusses his arrest and trial in 1982 on suspicion of gun running for the Irish Republican Army."

His grandfather and all of his uncles were policemen, and his aunt worked for the New York City Parks department. Fr.

Grange believes they were told to leave home because there was not enough food, and as a result they never went back to Ireland. Instead, his grandfather participated in the Irish American community in New York, joining the annual Feis, an Irish dance and music competition. His father was a very steady man, refusing to drink because his younger brother died from alcoholism. "

At that time, St. Jerome's was a growing parish with many vocations. He remembers that the priests had fancy cars and were very respected in the community.  The only priest from Ireland in the parish left to go on a mission to Peru, where he was threatened by the terrorist group, the Shining Path , but survived to afterwards become the Chaplain of Cork University. Fr. Grange discusses another woman he knows who was killed by the Shining Path. Fr. Grange then returns to discussing his schooling, describing the brothers as very strict and penal. After graduating St. Jerome's, Fr. Grange attended Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in Flushing, Queens, explaining that the students got off on Thursdays instead of Fridays, so that they could not attend dances. Fr. Grange's twin brother, Joseph, left after the first four years of seminary school, but Fr. Grange stayed on. Before being ordained in 1966, Fr. Grange took a year off to teach English and History at Immaculata High School in Manhattan. After his ordination, Fr. Grange noticed other priests who were learning Spanish and working with the growing communities of Puerto Ricans, which influenced him to go to language school in Puerto Rico. "

Grange explains that he was assigned to work at St. Columba School in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. While there, he became more involved with the Puerto Rican community. After six years, Fr. Grange was transferred to Annunciation School in Harlem, which was a primarily Dominican community. When Annunciation was given over to Spanish priests, he took the opportunity to arrange a transfer to St. Jerome's with the ambition of eventually becoming a pastor. In the 1980s, a large influx of Mexican immigrants started visiting him and attending church at St. Jerome's. Fr. Grange describes how mass attendance continued to grow over the years despite the difficulties the undocumented Mexican immigrant community faced. \nFr. Grange explains that in the late nineties, St. Jerome's began to physically decay, prompting him to confront Cardinal Egan about funding for the renovation. Cardinal Egan decided to give St. Jerome's the funding to renovate the Church, but three years later, he awarded the parish to a group of Argentinean priests and transferred Fr. Grange to St. Athanasius in the Bronx. Fr. Grange discusses the tension between the St. Jerome's parish and their new priests that stems from their cultural and religious differences. Fr. Grange also mentions the problem of illegal immigrants wanting to get married, but not being able to under New York law. Fr. Grange's new parish, St. Athanasius, is a mostly Puerto Rican community. He expresses concern for the parish, as most of the parishioners are elderly and oftentimes he performs several funerals a week. "

Although there has been an increase in Spanish-speaking priests in the archdiocese, many have not fully invested in the communities they serve. Fr. Grange expresses concern about recently installed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, considering the problematic relationship former Cardinal Egan had with the priests. Fr. Grange goes on to discuss the problematic role of Pope Benedict XVI and the schism in the Church between those who agree with the Vatican II changes and those who do not.

O'Carroll at the Irish Pastoral Centre in Boston, Massachusetts on March 12, 2015.  The interview covers Sister Marguerite Kelly's early life in Ireland, her life as a religious sister, and her working life in Boston, Massachusetts.  Kelly describes her family members and her childhood on a farm in County Galway, Ireland. She discusses her education, her decision to join the Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception in 1955, and the reaction of her parents to her vocation.  She recounts her early experiences of religious life, her postings in Italy and the United States (US), and her missionary work in Bolivia between the late 1960s and 1980. She discusses her education at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, her experiences teaching in the Boston area in the 1980s, and her work as a missionary in Peru in the late 1980s.  She discusses her return to the Boston area in 1989, her experiences between 1989 and her introduction to the Irish Pastoral Centre in 2004, and her work at the Centre between then and the time of the interview. She describes her responsibilities at the Centre, including her involvement in the senior citizen program and her work to write the Centre's by-laws."

However, after graduating in 1952, she was not yet sure of what she wanted to do, and went on to work in the accounting department at Pfizer Incorporated.  After five years, in 1957, Sister Theresa chose to join the Brooklyn Sisters of Mercy.  She talks about her various assignments at different schools, ranging from her first teaching assignment in Sunnyside, Queens, to a librarian at St. Patrick's on Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, as well as her work as principal at Our Lady of Refuge in East Flatbush, Brooklyn."

Sister Theresa describes the changes she saw in the Church, the effects the movement had on Catholic educations and the habit, as well as on the convent itself and the women within it.

She believes that before Vatican II the women in the convent had a strict schedule that was followed, and without that kind of structure the women felt lost; she points to this as one of the changes that provoked many women to leave.  She also disliked the changes in the habit.  She discusses in detail the full habit nuns used to wear before Vatican II, as well as why she enjoyed wearing it and why she still wears the modified habit today, even though it is not a requirement.  However, she does mention that she enjoyed the new freedom nuns had to vacation and visit family whenever they chose, as compared to before when time away from the convent was limited.  She describes her family's home in Breezy Point, Queens, and the joy it brought her to be able to go back there for vacations.  Sister also discusses the effects Vatican II had on the convent, the Church and religion in general, as well as its impact on Catholic educations. "

The interview covers Lyons's early life in Ireland, his life in the United States (US), and his participation in Irish republican organizations.  Lyons discusses his father's and uncle's experiences during the Irish Civil War as members of the Third Western Battalion of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and his experiences growing up in a family involved in Irish republican politics.  He discusses his immigration to the US in 1959, his decision to settle in New York City, and his working life in the city.

As the oldest son of Irish immigrants, he and his three siblings were educated in Catholic grammar schools and he and his sister both tested into prestigious public high schools.  He reflects on the importance of Irish identity for his parents and how they encouraged their children to build their own ethnic identity through music. Pat learned the button accordion and trained and competed with some well-known figures in the field of traditional music including Joannie Madden, Eileen Ivers, and Brian Conway. He describes his experience as the first American to win the All-Ireland championship in 1973 at the Fleadh in Listowel, Co. Kerry."

He reflects on his short stint as a professional musician that interrupted his undergraduate education at Fordham University and how the reality of making a living sent him back to City University of New York-Lehman College for a degree in accounting.  Despite a 20+ year career on Wall Street he has never abandoned his music and Mahon recalls how he pursued his passion for traditional music while stationed around the world for work, including years in Japan and England.  His discussion of the traditional music world and its active participants is among the most fascinating highlights of the interview, in particular, his memories of performing with Eileen Ivers in Japan are wonderful."

As an ex-pat for most of his adult life and career, his identity as a \"Yank\" created more of an identity issue for him."

O'Carroll at the Irish International Immigration Center in Boston, Massachusetts on March 11, 2015.  The interview covers Ronnie Millar's early life in Northern Ireland, his experiences of The Troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, and his working life.  Millar describes his parents and his siblings, and describes his family's identity as a mixed family, as his father was Protestant and his mother was Catholic. He recounts his family's moves between Ireland and England in the 1960s and 1970s and the lack of safety Millar felt as a child.  He recounts numerous stories about his experiences of The Troubles in Antrim, Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, including being evacuated from buildings and encountering violence during his daily life. He discusses leaving school around 1979 and entering the punk rock scene in Belfast.  He discusses the impact of his participation in the punk scene on his family, his decision to take an apprenticeship in 1982, and the fact that these events led him to reflect upon his religious faith. He discusses his decision to immigrate to the United States in 1995, his experiences of the differences between the Boston area and Belfast, and his appreciation of the opportunity to experience something different.  He describes the work of the Irish International Immigration Center and details their programs and services."

She declares that the only time she remembers her father using profanity was when she told him she wanted to enter the convent.  In a similarly vehement reaction, her mother tore up her acceptance letter to the Sisters of Charity, and it was only upon further inquiry with the order that Sister Regina Murphy learned she had been accepted.  Although her parents did not initially accept her vocation, Sister Regina Murphy says she felt truly called to enter the convent.  She recalls that she was especially stirred at the prospect of doing missionary work.  "

She talks about her appointment as Mission Coordinator for the order, and how she was able to visit missions in Guatemala.  She recalls meeting with a fellow sister named Barbara Ann Ford, who was influential in creating water projects in the poor villages and who participated in The Recovery of Historical Memory project organized by Bishop Juan Geraldi to collect the stories of the survivors and victims of the civil war in Guatemala.  Part of the project included providing mental health service for those who were affected by the rampant violence and crime that accompanied the war.  Sr. Barbara was shot and killed in 2001 under suspicious circumstance, however her work in Guatemala helped many and also influenced Sister Regina Murphy.  "

She recalls that the ICCR was successful in obtaining the signatures of fifty companies.  While Sister Regina Murphy was in one General Motors Factory in Northern Ireland, she talks about how her presence caused a temporary strike and shutdown of the factory.  Although she was not dressed in a traditional habit, workers guessed that she was a Catholic nun.  Seeing her discuss workplace issues with managers in the factory upset the predominately Protestant workers, inciting them to walk off the job.  Despite this fervor against the McBride Principles, it was her support, along with that of the ICCR, that she says helped to pass the Fair Employment Act.  "

O'Carroll at Brian O'Dwyer's office at O'Dwyer \u0026 Bernstein in New York, New York on May 5, 2016.  The interview covers O'Dwyer's family and working life. O'Dwyer discusses his parents, their extended families, and his siblings. He discusses his experiences in New York Irish American circles and the difficulties he faced making a name for himself after the work of his father and his cousin Frank Durkin in promoting Irish republican issues in the United States.  He recounts his decision to focus on the issues of Irish immigrants, and eventually all immigrants, in New York. He discusses his early involvement in the Irish Immigration Reform Movement in the 1980s, the role of O'Dwyer \u0026 Bernstein as the first stop for newly arrived Irish immigrants, and how his involvement in both of these organizations led to the founding of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC) in 1986.  He describes the support provided to immigrants through the EIIC. O'Dwyer discusses current immigration issues in the United States at the time of the interview, including division between Democrats and Republicans on the topic and the need for a new immigration policy in the US. He also discusses the Northern Ireland peace process in the 1990s and his views on the Catholic Church."

O'Carroll at James O'Malley's office in New York, New York on March 20, 2015.  The interview covers O'Malley's early life in Ireland and his working life in the United States (US). O'Malley describes his family members and his experiences growing up in Limerick City.  He discusses his education, his decision to transfer from Trinity College in Dublin to University College Galway, and his graduate education in the US. He discusses his decision to enter New York Law School and recounts his experiences working as a paralegal while attending classes at night between 1980 and 1984.  He recounts opening his law office in Manhattan in 1985, describes the growth of the firm, and discusses his decision to focus on immigration law. He also recounts his first impressions of the US in the 1978, his opinion about the creation in Ireland of a minister for the diaspora, and the politicization of New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade."

O'Carroll in Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland on July 17, 2014.  The interview covers Anne Rath's early life and education in Ireland, her immigration to the United States in 1986, and her work as a college professor in Ireland in the 1990s and 2000s.  Rath discusses her childhood in rural Ballycanew in County Wexford, Ireland, including her parents, their childhoods and professions. She discusses her work as a teacher in Cork, deciding to receive extra training in guidance counselling, and visiting Boston, Massachusetts in the summer of 1986.  She recalls working various jobs in the summer of 1986 before working at the British Consulate. She recounts her decision to return to Ireland in 1996, the difficulties she and her family faced with adjusting to the move, and the issues she faced returning to teaching. In particular she discusses the difficulties being a working mother with young children in Ireland, the lack of social life in Ireland for Rath and her partner, and the difficulties the family faced in adjusting to the differences in life, work, and school between the US and Ireland."

He discusses the establishment of Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID) in the mid-1970s. He recounts the events that led to his being jailed in Fort Worth, Texas and a member of the Fort Worth Five.  He discusses the other men imprisoned with him and their legal team led by Paul O'Dwyer. He also recounts his encounters with members of the Ulster Special Constabulary in his village in the 1950s and his memories of his reaction to Bloody Sunday in 1972."

He describes the bus ride to Selma and the unknown fear of what could happen during the march. He tells the story of the angry southerners yelling at those participating in the protest and how the atmosphere changed once the crowd recognized singer Harry Belafonte in the line of marchers. Back in New York, Ryan continued to participate in demonstrations on issues affecting all poor communities such as housing and health."

He speaks of the irony that as a young priest he served with three other priests in a parish and now as an older man he is the only priest in a bi-lingual parish.  Ryan is currently the longest serving pastor in the diocese of New York.  He spends his day running the parish with his other staff and administering to his parishioners' needs.  In addition to saying the majority of the masses at St. Luke's, he works with the parish council and leads a weekly session for the troubled teens of the parish. "

He came to the United States at the age of 20 and settled in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a blacksmith and became an active member and eventual president of the International Union of Journeymen Horseshoers.  James Sexton entered local politics in 1915 as Democratic District leader in the Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and by 1929 was serving Mayor James J. Walker as President of the New York City Board of Taxes and Assessments.  Sexton gives an example of his grandfather's character and influence during the Depression while head of Brooklyn's Jefferson Democratic Club."

Sexton describes how his father taught him the value of helping other people by bringing home what Sexton refers to as \"handymen.\"  Rather than renting out the extra room in their house, Sexton's father would take in homeless men who were frequently recovering alcoholics and allow them to stay until they got back on their feet.  Sexton acknowledges the centrality of his relationship with his father to subsequent choices he made in life, and briefly talks about his strained relationship with his uncle Jim Sexton.  He attributes his knowledge of his Irish heritage to his aunt Ruth Sexton (Sr. James Marie), a Dominican nun."

He talks about the pastor-like persona of all the Sexton men in his family and how readily it translates to his current position as President of New York University and Dean of its Law School before that.  Sexton attributes this love of people to being Irish and says this was passed down to him by his father.  Although he refers throughout the interview to the NYU Law School as his \"parish\" and the university as his \"archdiocese,\" Sexton does not otherwise agree with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. He discusses his personal concept of Catholicism and his relationship with the Church, reflecting on the Jewish identity of his wife, children and grandchildren."

He credits one of his teachers at Brooklyn Prep, Charlie Winans, with being the inspiration behind his efforts with the St. Brendan's debaters.  He recounts how his first application to Harvard Law School was rejected and how his friend, Lawrence Tribe, called in a few favors, convincing the admissions department to give his application reconsideration; nevertheless, Sexton's commitment to St. Brendan's was so great that he deferred going to law school until 1975.

She also recalls a funny story about having to choose between getting in trouble with her sister or a nun.

At vocational school she started to fall in love with learning as she acquired very practical skills like accounting and wood work.

He describes his anxiety of framing the historical events of the past for a contemporary audience. He recounts the way in which he wanted to create an environment where the half acre of land would let viewers interpret their own opinion about the Great Famine in Ireland in the 1840s. He describes his memories of witnessing the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11th, 2001."
