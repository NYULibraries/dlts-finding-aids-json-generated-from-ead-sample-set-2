Sam Kovenetsky was chosen to head the organizing drive. He began to work full-time for the union, along with other organizers including Marcella Loring and Bill Goltz. The union made its first gains among non-selling departments of Macy's inthe late 1930s, but by 1943, 54% of the salesclerks voted for union representation. Through negotiations, Local 1-S bargained for employee benefits and for language that eliminated racial and religious discrimination. Originally affiliated with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), in the wake of the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, Local 1-S and other left-wing locals seceded from the RWDSU but by 1955, 1-S re-affiliated with RWDSU."
