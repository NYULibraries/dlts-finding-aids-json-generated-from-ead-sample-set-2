Walkowitz Papers (dates 1967-2007) contain papers and video recordings related to the academic work and public history projects of historian and New York University professor Daniel J. Walkowitz. His papers include research files related to his book, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eWorking with Class\u003c/span\u003e, concerning social work and Jewish philanthropic organizations in New York City from the 1910s to the 1960s. These files contain photocopies from archival collections of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Jewish Board of Guardians, and the Social Service Employees' Union as well as newspaper clippings and secondary articles related to the topic. The files were compiled in the late 1980s and early 1990s and also contain Walkowitz's handwritten notes. Other research files in this collection relate to English folk dancing in the United States, and include transcripts of original oral history interviews, the majority of which were conducted by Walkowitz. The interviews date from 1999 and 2004, and were collected as research for his book \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eCity Folk\u003c/span\u003e. The collection also contains materials related to Walkowitz's historical films. These materials include copies of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant proposals, scripts, correspondence with collaborators, notes, research, and budgets. Films most prominently represented in this collection include \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eMolders of Troy\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eSisters\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePerestroika from Below\u003c/span\u003e, documenting iron workers in Troy, NY; class and gender in America; and a 1989 mass strike of mine workers in the Soviet Union. Walkowitz worked on these projects with his colleague Barbara Abrash from 1979 through the 1990s under the name Past Time Productions. Recordings of \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eMolders of Troy\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePerestroika from Below\u003c/span\u003e are included in the collection on reel-to-reel, VHS, and DVD. Additionally the collection contains a small amount of Walkowitz's teaching materials which consist of syllabi, course lists, lecture notes, and files related to departmental programs."
