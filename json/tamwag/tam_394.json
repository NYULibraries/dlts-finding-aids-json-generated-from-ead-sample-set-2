United States Department of Justice\u003c/span\u003e (US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, 1984-1987). The case was brought by Cynthia King who was planning to write a book about the career of her mother-in-law, Carol Weiss King.  Through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Ms. King sought access to Carol King's FBI file.  The initial response  provided 1,500 pages of the 1,665-page file, and from most of the 1,500 pages supplied, names and, frequently, substantial passages were redacted.  The FBI contended that two exemptions made these deletions appropriate -- Exemption 1 and Exemption 7. The lower court agreed.  The Court of Appeals, however, felt that additional justification would be required for those portions witheld based on Exemption 1 (\"...to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy...\") and, as a result, the FBI was compelled to create the Vaughn Index contained within this collection.
