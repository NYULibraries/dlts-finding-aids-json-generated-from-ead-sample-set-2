Six months after joining AFSCME, the Local joined the State, County and Municipal Workers of America, CIO as Local 45. After World War II, the SCMWA went into the United Public Workers which combined membership in the State Insurance Fund, Workers Compensation Board and State Department of Labor as one chapter of Local 1099, UPW. Six months before the UPW was expelled from the CIO, the chapter became the Union of State Employees (independent). When the CIO set up the Government and Civil Employees Orgnaizing Committee, USE received a charter to organize state employees throughout the state of New York as Local 382. Local 382 disbanded in 1982."
