At its peak in 1922, Newark's Chinatown was home to 3,000 residents but by the 1950s, they had dispersed as many families moved into New Jersey's suburbs. To recover the largely forgotten history of the neighborhood and the people who had once lived there, Skeete embarked on an archival and archaeological research project. As part of her research, she surveyed local churches, Newark's public libraries, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the New Jersey Historical Society for records and xeroxed or photographed documents to begin building a collection. She spearheaded an archeological dig of the area, unearthing privies and other objects from Newark's Chinatown, some of which are included in the collection. She also conducted oral histories of former residents and their descendants. Since building the collection, Skeete has organized various public programs at Sumei, including lectures, exhibits, and reunions of Newark Chinatown residents to raise awareness about these materials.

It is primarily comprised of photocopies from primary and secondary source materials related to the history of Newark's Chinatown and Asian Pacific American history. It also contains several maps of Newark neighborhoods and a small amount of correspondence with individuals regarding life in Newark Chinatown and sources related to Skeete's research. Also included are several drafts of Skeete's manuscript, \"When Newark Had a Chinatown\". These materials were compiled mostly between 2002 and 2010, but they cover a broad scope of Chinese American history dating from the 1660s up to the early 2000s with the largest focus on the years between 1890 and 1940."
