In 1903 she became an assistant to the editor of the Jewish Daily News in New York. In 1905 she married James Graham Phelps Stokes, a wealthy socialist and reformer.

There is also some discussion of literary and political matters, and the letters from 1930-1931 are concerned with Stoke's final illness.",
