The collection contains forty-one letters from Olive Tilford Dargan to Rose Pastor Stokes, two letters from Stokes to Dargan, a letter from the Tallahassee Power Company regarding the possibility of a reservoir covering some property owned by Dargan, and a telegram to Dargan from \"John and Mary.\" The letters between Dargan and Stokes are largely personal in nature, and indicate a close friendship. There is also some discussion of literary and political matters, and the letters from 1930-1931 are concerned with Stoke's final illness.",
