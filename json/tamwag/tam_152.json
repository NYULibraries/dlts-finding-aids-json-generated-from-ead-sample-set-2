Born in Bialystok, Russia on December 12, 1896, he immigrated to the United States with his family in 1906.  After settling in Detroit, Gorney took piano lessons and improvised music for the local silent film theater. He studied at the University of Michigan in the literary department and took music classes on the side in harmony, counterpoint, and composition.  He enlisted in the Navy during World War I and was stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center.  Later earning his LL.B degree, he practiced law for less than one year before deciding to move to New York City and work in musical theater.  "

He was ousted from his new job at CBS.
