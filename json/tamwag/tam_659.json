The magazine addressed issues of feminism, gender and sexuality, international affairs, social justice, political and economic systems, cultural theory, and postmodern critical theory. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the magazine was associated with the New American Movement and its politics shifted toward a more Social Democratic perspective. In 1978, the magazine was renamed \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eSocialist Review\u003c/span\u003e when the publication absorbed the serial \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eMarxist Perspectives\u003c/span\u003e. In 2002 the magazine's name changed again to \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eRadical Society: A Review of Culture and Politics\u003c/span\u003e and from 2002 to 2003 was published by Routledge. In 2006 independent publisher Radical Society Ltd., took over publishing and relaunched Radical Society's website."
