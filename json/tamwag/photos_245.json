There are also three photographs unrelated to the I.W.O. which are credited to Joe Hall and depict the unemployed and breadlines in New York City during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Four color snapshots are of an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in New York City, probably during the late 1970s. Two photographs are portraits of Ernest Rymer, one taken by his cousin, S. Rymer."

A number of political and/or commemorative buttons and pins on a variety of topics are also present, including approximately 40 pins, a keychain, and some miscellaneous small artifacts from the Soviet Union."
