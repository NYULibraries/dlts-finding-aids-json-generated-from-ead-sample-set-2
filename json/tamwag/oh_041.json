He has revived dozens of labor songs as well as composing some which have become traditional including \"The Mill was Made of Marble,\" \"Automation,\" and \"Too Old to Work, Too Young to Die.\"  He is a founder of the Labor Heritage Foundation, a national organization which promotes labor music, drama and culture and for the past twenty years, has organized an annual \"Labor Arts Exchange\" at the George Meany Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.",
