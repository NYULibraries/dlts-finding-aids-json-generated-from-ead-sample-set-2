As a leading organization in the CIO's \"Operation Dixie,\" it led numerous organizing campaigns in the union-resistant South, aiming to help textile workers achieve higher wages, health insurance and other benefits, and to ensure fair labor practices.  The TWUA was able to organize new plants and revive some moribund organizations, but it was unable to achieve a breakthrough win which would organize the whole industry. The TWUA's textile locals eventually became part of UNITE/HERE, a manufacturing and hospitality workers union."
