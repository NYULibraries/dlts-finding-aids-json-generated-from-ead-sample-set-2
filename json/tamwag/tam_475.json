In 1926 Lowenfels fled to Paris to write and to escape a career in the family business. In 1930 he and Michael Fraenkel founded the Carrefour Press and published the pamphlet \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAnonymous: The Need for Anonymity\u003c/span\u003e, a manifesto in which they declared that anonymous publication was the only way to avoid artistic competition and alienation. A play by Lowenfels, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eUSA with Music\u003c/span\u003e, was published anonymously by Carrefour, but a plagiarism suit brought by Lowenfels against George Gershwin in 1932 forced Carrefour and Lowenfels to reveal the author's identity.

The charges were based solely on his membership in the Communist Party and the conviction was overturned in a matter of weeks. Although Lowenfels was recognized as a poet in his own right throughout his life, from the late 1950's until his death in 1976, he was best known as the pre-eminent American anthologist of the avant-garde. Many of his collections of poetry reflect his commitment to Marxism and opposition to political repression. Among his political anthologies are \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eWhere is Vietnam?\u003c/span\u003e(1967), \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eIn The Time of Revolution\u003c/span\u003e(1969), \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eFrom the Belly of the Shark\u003c/span\u003e(1973), and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eFor Neruda, for Chile\u003c/span\u003e(1975).
