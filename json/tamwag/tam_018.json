Like many Eastern European Orthodox Jews in the late nineteenth century, her parents, Samuel and Deborah (Rothman) Schneiderman, worked in the sewing trades to support their impoverished family, at first in Saven and then in the industrial city of Khelm. When Rose was eight they emigrated to New York City's Lower East Side. Her father's death there in the winter of 1892 left the family dependent upon relatives and charity. Rose and her brothers spent over a year in Jewish orphanages before their mother could reunite them."

Throughout her life she continued a program of self education and was an omnivorous reader."

Three years later, in 1898, she found a better paying position as a sewing machine operator in a cap factory. Despite the oppressive conditions that characterized both retail stores and clothing factories in the late nineteenth century, her interest in trade unionism did not develop immediately. Like most young women wage earners of that day, she regarded her time in industry as temporary, to be given up for marriage or a teaching career. As she recalled in her autobiography, \"We had no idea that there was a union in our industry and that women could join it. Nor did we have a full realization of the hardships we were undergoing.\""

In 1902 her family moved briefly to Montreal, where close friendship with a socialist family stirred her interest in radical politics and trade unionism. Soon after her return to the'New York cap factory in 1903, she joined another new friend, Bessie Braut, a young anarchist, in organizing the women in their shop. They applied for a charter to the United Cloth Hat and Cap Makers Union, a vigorous Jewish socialist organization, but the union, reluctant to take women members, told them to come back after they had succeeded in organizing twenty five women a task they accomplished within a few days. The union then chartered its first women's local."

Her local, largely under her direction, rapidly grew to several hundred members. She was elected its secretary and one of its delegates to the New York City Central Labor Union. Previously a quiet, introverted, often unhappy young woman, she now came into her own. She joined the Socialist party and, in 1905, the New York Women's Trade Union League, the organization she was later to call \"the most important influence in my life.\""

Although hesitant at first about an organization containing so many upperclass women, she made her decision to join and quickly became a leading member. By 1908 she was the League's vice president and one of its most effective organizers. In that year a stipend provided by Irene Lewisohn, one of the League's wealthy supporters, enabled her to give up factory employment and work for the League, meanwhile continuing her education at the Rand School of Social Science."

As the League's East Side organizer, she helped found numerous women's unions, primarily among Jewish immigrants. She was active in the 1909 general strike of the shirtwaist makers, the \"Uprising of the Twenty Thousand,\" and served on the shirtwaist makers' union's executive board. She also established, virtually single handedly, a small union of white goods workers that became Local 62 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. As its first president and organizer, she led it carefully from its precarious beginnings in 1908 through its general strike in 1913."

She spent a year in the job, traveling throughout the East and Midwest to organize shirtwaist makers, but found working for a male dominated trade union frustrating and unfulfilling. The experience seems to have deepened her commitment to the Women's Trade Union League and to the woman's movement generally. Throughout the second decade of the twentieth century she was an active suffragist, and throughout her career she did not hesitate to voice criticism of union policies that indicated insensitivity to women's concerns. She became president of the New York League in 1918, and in 1926 accepted the presidency of the National WTUL as well, although the New York League remained her primary focus."

As president of the New York League, she channeled much of her energy into lobbying at the state capitol for protective legislation for women, particularly eight hour and minimum wage laws. She also gave vigorous opposition to the new Equal Rights Amendment proposed by the National Woman's Party."

Earlier a Socialist, she helped organize the state Labor party in 1919 and was its candidate for U.S. Senator on the Farmer Labor ticket of 1920. So strong was her reputation at this time as a political radical that she was assailed by conservative groups as \"Red Rose\" and was one of the individuals investigated by New York's Lusk Committee. Over the next few years, however, the decline of the Socialist and Farmer Labor parties and her friendship with Democratic activists within the New York WTUL Iike Nancy Cook and especially Eleanor Roosevelt (who joined the League late in 1922) drew her toward that party. She was pleased when the Democratic governor, Al Smith, appointed her a state delegate to a child labor conference in Washington in 1924. Though she campaigned that fall for the Progressive presidential candidate, La Follette, she also voted for Smith. Before long she had become a staunch Democrat."

Schneiderman played a leading role in the New York City garment workers upsurge of 1909-14 and was founder and president of International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), Local 62, Dry Goods Workers. After losing her bid for the presidency of the New York WTUL, she became in 1914 a national organizer for the ILGWU but, dissatisfied with the place of women in the Union, returned to the WTUL in 1916, and became head of the NY WTUL in 1918, and later the national WTUL, holding both posts throughout the remainder of the WTUL's existence (through 1950). After World War I, her focus shifted to legislative reform (with the notable exception of her opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment), and she drew close to the Democratic party and established a friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt. Schneiderman served on the National Recovery Administration's labor advisory board in 1934, and as Secretary of the New York State Department of Labor 1933-44. Her autobiography, \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eAll for One\u003c/span\u003e, was published in 1967. This collection contains correspondence (leading feminists are represented), a set of letters from Pauline Newman, autobiographical typescripts, speeches, clippings, minutes, reports, and other documents representing Schneiderman's activity in WTUL, in public service, and in the women's suffrage movement.",

Schneiderman's participation in the suffrage movement finds reflection in scattered letters from Alva E. Belmont, Harriot Stanton Blatch, Inez Milholland, Anna Howard Shaw, and Harriet Taylor Upton. Upton's letter of July 17, 1912, and one from M. A. Sherwood, July 15, testify warmly to Schneiderman's effectiveness in the Ohio suffrage campaign of that year. A few letters, especially those of Joseph E. Cohen, touch upon socialist matters. Other correspondents include the labor leaders John Dyche and Hugh Frayne and Florence Simms of the YWCA."

With three exceptions, each year is represented by no more than half a dozen items; some years are skipped altogether. The exceptions are large clusters of letters and telegrams sent on three occasions: in 1937, at the time of Schneiderman's appointment as New York State Secretary of Labor; in 1943, in observance of the twenty fifth anniversary of her presidency of the New York Women's Trade Union League; and in 1949, when she retired from that post. Corrpspondents in this portion of the reel include Margaret Dreier Robins (see esoecially June 24, 1922, June 14, 1943, and Schneiderman's reply of July 7, 1943), Mary Dreier, Leonora O'Reilly, Elisabeth Christman (including several letters in 1950 describing the closing down of the National WTUL headquarters), Frances Perkins, the English labor leader Margaret Bondfield, Franklin D. Roosevelt (several letters during his governorship), and Eleanor Roosevelt. On trade union affairs, Schneiderman in a letter of Feb. 6, 1916 to Benjamin Schlesinger submits her resignation as an ILGWU organizer. (See also her letter to Abe Baroff, Dec 1, 1916, on Reel 2, frames 262-263.) A letter from Max Zaritsky, June 7, 1934, announces her election to the general executive board of her own union, the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers. Several letters in 1938-1939 concern the National Women's Committee for a Leon Blum Colony in Palestine, of which Schneiderman was chair."

Included in the first group are: typed copies of reports in the Chicago Union Labor Advocate of the founding meetings of the National WTUL in 1903 (by one of the participants, Ellen Lindstrom), of the national \"convention\" of 1907 (actually a small conference held during the annual convention of the American Federation of Labor), and of early meetings of the Chicago and Boston branches; a typed report by Rose Schneiderman of her work as organizer for the New York WTUL in 1908-1909; minutes of a meeting of the Law Enforcement Committee of the New York WTUL in 1913; and the script of the League's surprise party for Schneiderman in 1943. In the second group (speeches and articles), each ofthe first two speeches lacks page 1. In a speech or article at the end of the group Schneiderman looks back over the fifty-year history of the New York WTUL after its decision to disband."

The overall dates are 1909 through 1964, but the greatest concentration falls in the years before World War I. The letters for those years deal with personal and family matters, trade union and Women's Trade Union League affairs, woman suffrage, and, more briefly, socialism. They give some insight into the day to day life and concerns of an early twentieth century woman labor organizer. Much of the correspondence is from friends in the Women's Trade Union League, the labor movement, and the suffrage campaign.
