This action was not authorized by any union although it did win the backing of the High School Teachers Association (HSTA) and the Teachers Guild.

The Teachers Union was supportive of the idea but the HSTA preferred a plan of its own that would call for mass resignations of high school teachers.  In early April, after a week-long Easter vacation, the New York City school system was facing the threat of a major teacher work stoppage."
