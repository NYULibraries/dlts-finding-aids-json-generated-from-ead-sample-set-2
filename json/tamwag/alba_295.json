After graduation she traveled to Spain to study at the University of Mardid.  There she met and married a Spanish doctor, Tadeo Campuzano; their son Carlos was born in 1933.  When war broke out in 1936 her husband served as a doctor on a Republican ship, and after a year of wartime hardships she left Spain with their young son. Returning to Kansas City she spoke on behalf on the Republican cause, sometimes sharing the platform with Kenneth Graeber (aka Graber, another graduate of the University of Kansas), who had served as an ambulance driver in Spain. This collection of clippings and notes is not explicitly identified as to ownership; they were probably compiled by either Campuzano or Graeber."
