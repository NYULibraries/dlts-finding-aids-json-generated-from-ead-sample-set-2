He worked as a Communist Party of the United States of America organizer briefly in Harlem while he lived in a Lower East Side rooming house and looked for construction work. At some point he apprenticed as a pipefitter, despite an unofficial anti-ethnic bar. He was one of the few \"proletarian worker-writers\" in the Communist Party's John Reed Club. With the help of Party regulars, he soon published a novella, \"Going East,\" in the Daily Worker  Sunday Supplement (August 22-September 14, 1934). He was acquainted with Mike Gold and (then leftist) Philip Rahv. Always a Trotskyist, he shaken by the Moscow Trials and the death of Leon Trotsky. He broke with the Stalinists after he  became critical of Party orthodoxy. From the mid-1940s onward, he was active in the Brotherhood of Plumbers and Pipefitters, Local Union No. 2, AFL-CIO. At some point in the war years, rewarded after a stateside army stint and having changed his name to Harris, he became a naturalized citizen."
