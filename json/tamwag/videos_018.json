She recounts her opposition of the party leaders, including her father Herbert Aptheker, at the 1968 Communist Party convention over the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia. She also discusses her sexuality, coming out as a lesbian in the 1970s, and homophobia in the Communist Party. Other topics she addresses include the Vietnam War, civil rights, the Black Panthers, Angela Davis, and the FBI's covert program COINTELPRO."

She discusses her work as an organizer for social justice marches and demonstrations, her involvement with anti-war groups like Mobilization for Survival and for LGBT rights, and her work with politicians like David Dinkins and Bill de Blasio. She also discusses her involvement in anti-war activism, and the differences between the movement before and after the 2001 September 11th terrorist attacks."

Hobson discusses the allegations made by ex-Communist Whittaker Chambers and his claims about being close with the Hiss family. Hobson describes his personal memories of Chambers and his family, and the Hiss defense team's decision not to call Hobson to the stand as a witness in his stepfather's perjury trials. Hobson also discusses the \"undesirable\" discharge he received from the U.S. Navy for admitting he was gay, and the effects of that discharge later in his life."
