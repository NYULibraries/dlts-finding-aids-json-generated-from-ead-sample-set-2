The oral history runs approximately 180 minutes. The interview covers the espionage allegations against Hobson's stepfather Alger Hiss. Hobson discusses the allegations made by ex-Communist Whittaker Chambers and his claims about being close with the Hiss family. Hobson describes his personal memories of Chambers and his family, and the Hiss defense team's decision not to call Hobson to the stand as a witness in his stepfather's perjury trials. Hobson also discusses the \"undesirable\" discharge he received from the U.S. Navy for admitting he was gay, and the effects of that discharge later in his life."
