Weisburd's slides document his trips to Iceland, Aruba, Nova Scotia, the Florida Everglades, New England, Paris, Puerto Rico, Santiago, Africa, China, the USSR, Cuba, Chicago, New York City, Washington D.C. (for many demonstrations), Philadelphia (for a demonstration related to the U.S. Bicentennial), Nicaragua, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Most of the slides are labeled with location or date.  The scrapbook was presented to Abe by family and friends on his 70th birthday and was added to for subsequent birthdays. It contains writings by Weisburd, biographical notes, photos, and letters from friends and family."
