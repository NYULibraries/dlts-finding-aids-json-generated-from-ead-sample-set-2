In the same year he became an organizer for the Knights of Labor. Ameringer joined the Socialist Party in 1901, and became a leader and activist in the socialist and labor movement. In addition to working on the campaign to elect Victor Berger to the U.S. House of Representatives, Ameringer also ran for office for mayor of Oklahoma City in 1911 and lost narrowly. After World War I, Oscar Ameringer helped form the Farmer-Labor Reconstruction League which won the Oklahoma governorship for John Walton. By the 1930s, Ameringer worked as an editor, publisher, and writer for Socialist publications, including the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAmerican Guardian\u003c/span\u003e and the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eIllinois Miner\u003c/span\u003e (later the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAmerican Miner\u003c/span\u003e). In addition to writing under his own name, Ameringer wrote articles under the pseudonym \"Adam Coaldigger.\" In 1940, Ameringer wrote an autobiography, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eIf You Don't Weaken\u003c/span\u003e. Ameringer died on November 5, 1943, in Oklahoma City."
