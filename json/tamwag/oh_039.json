After pursuing a secular college education, Deane came out just before the draft board examination and \"1-Y\" classification. He was an officer of the Cincinatti NAACP and was an activist in the fair housing movement in the Midwest. He participated in civil rights campaigns to integrate construction unions and mid-1960's cooperative housing projects of the Chicago Joint Board of Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. Deane was also an openly gay candidate in the 1977 campaign for City Council Brooklyn delegate-at-large and was involved in the founding of the Brooklyn Lambda Independent Democrats. His interview touches on the topics of gay life in Chicago, social life, gay identity in ACWA, conflicts with leadership, career in NYC cooperative housing and activity in NYC Liberal Party."
