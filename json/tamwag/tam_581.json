The largest portion of the collection relates to the organization's unceasing search for funds (contracts, grants, proposals, and related material).  However, there is also significant coverage of the Network's activities and programs that provided education, support, and guidance to teenagers in the Bronx, particularly on the topics of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.  The files of executive director Agnes Cooper Dennis are especially well-represented, as is the Better Bronx for Youth program."
