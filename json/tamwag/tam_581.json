However, there is also significant coverage of the Network's activities and programs that provided education, support, and guidance to teenagers in the Bronx, particularly on the topics of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.  The files of executive director Agnes Cooper Dennis are especially well-represented, as is the Better Bronx for Youth program."
