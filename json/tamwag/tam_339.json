However, in the longer version he appears as \"Rocky Greco,\" while in the shorter version he appears under his own name.

The manuscript of the 127 pp. version is accompanied by a copy of a letter (13 July, 1974) from Gold's widow, Elizabeth Humeston, to Simon Gerson, in which she requests a copy of the untitled pamphlet (described below), and in which she states: \"In 1948, we were in France [through 1952]. Later, Mike wrote his life, in the form of a play.\" This suggests that The Honorable Pete was actually written ca. 1953.  (Note, however, that Alan Wald, on p. 53 of his \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eExiles from a Future Time: The Forging of the Mid-Twentieth Century Literary Left\u003c/span\u003e, states  \"in 1948 he [Gold] released parts of a play based on the life of…Pete Cacchione…\").

Gerson (longtime Communist Party New York State legislative director, and Cacchione's friend and campaign manager), that was apparently addressed to International Publishers, the Communist Party, USA publishing firm. In this memo, Gerson critically evaluates the manuscript, suggests that what is needed is a full-length biography of Cacchione, and announces his intention to write a such a book, the subsequently-published \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePete: The Story of Peter V.
