In 2005 ETAN changed its name to the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (although it retained the same acronym, ETAN) to better reflect its goals of supporting rights, justice, and democracy in both East Timor and Indonesia. ETAN works for justice for historic and ongoing crimes against humanity, war crimes, and human rights violations in East Timor and Indonesia."

The East Timorese guerrilla force, Falintil, fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 to 1999. Amnesty International estimated that during Indonesia's occupation, some 200,000 \"excess deaths,\" mainly from hunger and illness. Following the UN-sponsored act of self-determination that year, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory and East Timor became the first new country of the twenty-first century in 2002. Alongside the Philippines, East Timor is one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia, and the only Portuguese-speaking sovereign state in Asia."
