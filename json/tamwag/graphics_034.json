The Council began achieving significant growth after the arrival, in 1947, of Executive Director Jerry Wurf. Over the next five years, DC 37 formed 55 new locals or organizing committees. The union continued to grow through organizing, mergers, and consolidation. By 1957, the Council claimed a membership of 25,000 members in 33 city agencies and departments. The 1950s and early 1960s also witnessed increasing militancy on the part of DC 37 members, as workers struck at numerous city agencies."

Taibi soon resigned due to ill health, however, and Victor Gotbaum (b. 1921), a Chicago-based AFSCME representative, stepped in to lead DC 37. In his first few years as Executive Director, Gotbaum dealt with a 28-day strike in 1965 by members working as caseworkers and in other capacities for New York City's Welfare Department, and the passing of New York State's Taylor Law in 1967, which prohibits state employees from striking. Gotbaum brought with him from Chicago a talented organizer, Lillian Roberts (b. 1928), who had been a nurse's aide and vocal shop steward prior to joining Gotbaum's AFSCME staff in Illinois. Roberts' success in organizing nurses' aides in city hospitals for DC 37's Local 420 helped to put the Council over the threshold needed for a citywide majority of career and salary plan employees, and membership surpassed 50,000 in 1967. Roberts was appointed Associate Director of the union in 1968."

In 2002, Lillian Roberts was elected to serve as Executive Director of DC 37, returning after a twenty-year absence.
