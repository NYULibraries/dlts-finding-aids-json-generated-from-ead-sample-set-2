This act, known as the McCarran Act after its author Senator Pat McCarran, did not outlaw the Communist Party but sought to secure its control through regulation. It required registration with the United States government of domestic \"communist-action organizations\" (defined as organizations substantially under the control of \"the world-wide communist movement\") and of domestic \"communist-front organizations\" (defined as organizations substantially under the control of \"communist-action organizations\"). The Attorney General might petition the Subversive Activities Control Board to order the registration of specific organizations under one or the other of these rubrics. The Board, made up of five members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, was in turn empowered to hold hearings to determine whether these were indeed \"communist-action\" or \"communist-front\" organizations, and if so, to order them to register as such. Registration entailed annual provision of financial records and membership lists."
