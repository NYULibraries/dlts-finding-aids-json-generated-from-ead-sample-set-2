Napoli by the artist David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) in 1979 and 1980. As a bookseller at the now-defunct Bookmasters bookshop in the late 1970s, Anthony M. Napoli worked alongside a young Wojnarowicz, and upon Wojnarowicz's move to France, kept in touch with him by mail. Wojnarowicz sent Napoli book recommendations and described the condition of his life in Paris and Normandy, writing in a single-spaced, associative manner that is reminiscent of his later work in \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eThe Waterfront Journals\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eClose to the Knives\u003c/span\u003e. Napoli resumed contact with Wojnarowicz when the artist returned to America to live in an apartment near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The collection consists of five letters - three from Paris, two from Brooklyn - as well as a flyer for Wojnarowicz's performance, \"Leaning With That Grey Beast of Desire\", excerpts from the \u003cspan class=\"ead-title\"\u003eSoHo Weekly News\u003c/span\u003e' publication of \"Rimbaud In New York\", and a catalog from Pocaio's Bookshop in Bonn, Germany."
