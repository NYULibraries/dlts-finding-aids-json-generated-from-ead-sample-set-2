Along with that and the attention to the profession given by the media, a new category has emerged—the Celebrity Chef. No one of them is better-known than Tom Colicchio.  Already a highly respected and well-reviewed chef and restaurateur when he became the head judge of the wildly popular television program Top Chef, Colicchio is probably the best-known chef in America. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a young teenager, he  started cooking at home, discovered he enjoyed it and worked his way through a swim club food concession, a Burger King, and increasingly more ambitious restaurants in his native New Jersey before  heading to Manhattan.  His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin's on method and technique.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHe came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York's Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, 'wichcraft. In 2010 his work at Craft was honored when the Beard Foundation named him the country's Outstanding Chef.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nColicchio is married to his frequent writing partner, the documentary filmmaker Lori Silverbush."

The book demystified  Indian food  and in a way,  was a reflection of her own introduction to Indian cooking, once she left New Delhi to pursue an acting career in England and America. Like many upper class Indian women, Jaffrey hadn't learned to cook as a child. Once she left home, she longed for the food of her childhood. Letters from her mother as well as Jaffrey's own strong sense of taste set her on her way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA well-known Indian actress, Jaffrey was at home in front of cameras and. As her food writing career developed, that experience made her a natural for television. Since that first cookbook—then praised by New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne as \"perhaps the best Indian cookbook available in English\"—she has written 28 more, many of them in tandem with multiple television series both in the United States and the UK. She has also written countless newspaper and magazine articles, and continued a much-praised  acting career. Both of those threads of her life are discussed in this interview."

Although he kept a home in Northern California, Wolf has maintained a New York presence ever since.

The food Tim Zagat ate at school wasn't much better. \"Chicken a la King was a high point,\" he recalls.
