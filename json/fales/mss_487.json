The bulk of the collection is approximately 400 printed postcards, collected between 1970 and 2015, covering a range of topics, especially politically left-leaning ideology, but also includes reproductions of artworks and travel destinations. The collection also includes a group of collectible \"Doom of Youth\"-themed cards designed by John Stalin from the early 1980s. Original photographs most likely taken by Spore's former husband, Ken Brown, during the 1970s and 1980s are also in this collection. Photographic subjects include musician portraits, city street scenes, and political protests in New York and Toronto.",

Spore's postcards cover a wide range of topics, the majority politically left-leaning ideology related to issues such as civil liberties, women's and workers' rights, Marxism, and nuclear testing or use protests. Some of the postcards are reproductions of political propaganda posters,  political cartoons, museum artworks, animals, images of musicians and artists, and travel destinations. A small number of the cards are postmarked and contain messages to Spore, while the remainder are blank. The collection also includes exhibition announcements, invitations, and collectible \"Doom of Youth\"-themed cards designed by John Stalin from the early 1980s. This collection also contains original photographs most likely taken by her former husband, Ken Brown, including portraits of musicians Charles Mingus, Link Wray, Jimi Hendrix, Screaming Jay Hawkins during the 1970s and 1980s. Images of political protests and everyday streets scenes in New York City and Toronto during the 1970s and 1980s are also included in this collection."
