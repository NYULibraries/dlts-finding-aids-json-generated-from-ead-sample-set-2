The photocopied research materials give an overview of Edgar Allan Poe's personal and professional life ranging from his childhood, family history  and romantic relationships with alleged fiance Sarah Elmira Royster and wife Virginia Poe. They consist of correspondence and journal entries from various manuscript and archival collections across the United States, maps of Poe's homes in various cities such as  Baltimore and Philadelphia, newspaper articles and book extractions from about 1800 to the late 1890s. Silverman was also well known for his research intensive writing process. The Kenneth Silverman Papers is a reflection of this process."
