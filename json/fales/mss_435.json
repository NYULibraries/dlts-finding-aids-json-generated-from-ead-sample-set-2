Pyramid began as a standard dive bar, but evolved into the epicenter of a diverse underground art and performance scene under the attentions of Bobby Bradley, Alan Mace and Victor Sapienza. All three men were employees at the nightclub Interferon, and were later joined by Brian Butterick, who had been an employee at Mudd Club. Home to many of the most well known drag performers of the time, such as Lady Bunny and Ethyl Eichelberger, Pyramid was also a cornerstone in the neighborhood's LGBT community. It opened officially as a nightclub in December of 1981 and continues to operate today, largely as a throwback 80's dance club."
