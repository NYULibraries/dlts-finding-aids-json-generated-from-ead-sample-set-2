Hanna discusses being verbally abused at a show in Boston from a man who also punched her roadie Laura. That same man went on to murder a woman with a gun. Hanna talks about the importance of combatting misogyny at shows, since it is perpetuated by the same men who violently assault women outside of shows.

Naylor also talks about the relationship between queercore and riot grrrl; the limits of queercore music; the decline of radicalism within gay culture, and the impact that professionalization in the music industry has had upon the ability of new music scenes to emerge."
