Throughout their 30 year friendship, Giannini and Enslin corresponded regularly from their homes in New Mexico, Maine, and western Massachusetts, discussing weather, gardening, politics, health and personal issues, and their careers. The two friends also critiqued each other's writings, as well as shared reading recommendations. News and critiques of other writer friends including Cid Corman, John Taggart, and George Oppen can also be found in this collection. These letters offer a private view into a long-term friendship between writers who shared personal news, disagreements, but also encouraged each other artistically."
