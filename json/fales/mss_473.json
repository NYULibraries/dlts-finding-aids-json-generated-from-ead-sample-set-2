He worked for many years at Ervin's Bakery on North Charles Street in Baltimore. He was known to use only fresh ingredients and refused to use artificial food-color dyes, but made his own from fruits. When the owners of Ervin's passed away, the younger generation sold and closed the bakery. Kemstedt then worked at the Hochschold Kohn Department Store's bakery in downtown Baltimore. He developed health issues and died at the age of sixty-one in 1956."

Herman Kemstedt's handwritten recipe book documents not only his baking practices, but also stands as an example of a manuscript cookbook and the ways in which cooking and baking methods intersect with economics, immigration patterns, and family histories. Waller's material contains files related to his series of Drinkology books, including publicity, appearances, and clippings. A small selection of restaurant menus and play/event programs collected by Waller, are also in this collection."
