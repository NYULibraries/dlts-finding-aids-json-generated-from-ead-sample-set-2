During her tenure as a rock journalist, Goldstein interviewed numerous musicians including Harry Nilsson, Brian Wilson, Del Shannon, and Lesley Gore. She also held editorial positions for the New York Post and the Daily News. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Goldstein converted to Christianity, which eventually led her to join the Roman Catholic Church. She received her doctorate in sacred theology (S.T.D.) from the University of St. Mary of the Lake in 2016, becoming the first woman in the university's history to earn a canonical doctorate.
