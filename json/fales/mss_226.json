The unique \"personality\" that Gertie exhibited was a new development in animated cartoons and is considered largely responsible for Gertie's success.  In addition to the innovativeness of McCay's art work, he is also credited with developing several important animation techniques, including registration marks, \"inbetweening\" or keyframe animation, stationary local animation, the use of thin tracing paper, and the cycling of drawings.
