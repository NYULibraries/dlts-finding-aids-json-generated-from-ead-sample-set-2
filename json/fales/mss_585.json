After serving in the United States Army from 1967 to 1968, Worman moved to San Francisco where he joined a cross-dressing improvisational theatre troupe called The Cockettes in July of 1970. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Cockettes had formed on New Years Eve, 1969 when a group of hippies dressed in drag, lead by Hibiscus (George Harris, a young actor/model) offered to perform an opening act at San Francisco's Palace Theatre in exchange for free tickets to see the movie. The Cockettes were a success, eventually becoming the principal draw to the Palace. By the end of 1970, Hibiscus and several followers left to form their own group, the Angels of Light. The remaining Cockettes went on to produce more shows, with Worman writing scripts for sketches and song lyrics. Their popularity grew, culminating in a one month engagement in New York, at the Anderson Theatre in the East Village in November 1971. Back in San Francisco, The Cockettes performed several more shows, including \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eA Journey to the Center of Uranus\u003c/span\u003e, with special guest star, Divine, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eHot Greeks\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePearls Over Shanghai\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eL'Etoiles de Paris\u003c/span\u003e. By the autumn of 1972 the group dissolved. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 1979 Worman moved to New York where he worked as assistant director and director for various theatrical shows. While living in New York, Worman attended New York University for a doctorate in Performance Studies. He also taught at NYU in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then worked as an assistant professor of drama at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1992 he was hired to develop a regional theater company at Antioch College. Worman died in 1993."
