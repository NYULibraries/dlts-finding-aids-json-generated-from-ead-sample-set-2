The menus span a diverse range of New York City geography, covering large portions of Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. Additionally, Dr. Meyer's collection covers roadside destinations around the Tri-State area in Long Island, Jersey, and upstate New York. This collection offers perspective on commerce, cuisine, and graphic design in the New York City area during the mid-twentieth century."
