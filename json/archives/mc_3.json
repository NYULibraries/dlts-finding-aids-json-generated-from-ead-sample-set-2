One of these manuscripts regards the subject of music through the ages (folder 19); it is incomplete and also not dated. Here Marion Bauer treats the development of music from about the ninth century onwards through the twentieth century. She considers a variety of subjects including forms of music (part music, motets and madrigals, the birth of the opera and new instrumental forms); types of musicians (troubadours, minnesingers, etc.); particular composers (Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart and others); and she also discusses the development of music in relation to Classicism, Romanticism, Nationalism and Impressionism. The second manuscript concerns the National Federation of the Music Clubs (folder 20); this document is presumably complete and the contents pertaining to the Young Composers Contest of 1947 suggest that it may have been a speech that Marion Bauer gave in 1947. \"Contemporary Trends in 'Choral Compositions\" (folder 21) is apparently the complete manuscript of a talk for the New York Federation of Music Clubs, which took place in Binghamton, New York, on April 20-23, 1938. \"A List of Contemporary Piano Music: Grade II and Grade III\" (folder 22) and \"American Piano Music\" (folder 23) are two manuscripts in the collection, which appear to be complete, although there is no indication that some of these manuscripts were actually published."
