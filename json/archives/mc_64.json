Dr. Townsend chaired a committee on college reading for the National Council of Teachers of English in 1933. For the council, he created a list of the top 100 most significant books for college readers, polling professors and other academics to compile a substantial guideline for students. In 1943 Dr. Townsend acted as executive secretary for the third Free World Congress in New York. He remained a professor of English at NYU until his retirement in 1961. He died in 1967."
