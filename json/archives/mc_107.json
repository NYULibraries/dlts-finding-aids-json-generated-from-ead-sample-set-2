The material dates from 1916 to 1988, with the bulk of the material dating from 1981 to 1988, and includes Girard's memoirs, programs, clippings, newspapers, newsletters, correspondence, and photographs. Material in the collection includes programs, clippings, and correspondence regarding WSC and NYU events from the 1920s through the 1970s; and correspondence, newsletters, and legal and financial documents regarding the Trigonon Society  and Scholastic Loan Fund, with which Girard was associated from the 1950s through the 1970s.  Much of the collection consists of drafts and a final version of Girard's memoirs, which are based on a series of questions posed by Still in the early 1980s in order to capture Girard's long association with NYU.  Also included is correspondence between Girard and Bayrd Still regarding Girard's recollections from his time as a student at Washington Square College's night school, as an economics professor in NYU's School of Commerce, and the history of various schools at NYU."
