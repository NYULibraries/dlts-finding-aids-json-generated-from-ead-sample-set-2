He studied under John Draper and developed a great knowledge and love for chemistry and physics. In 1851 he became a professor at the College of the City of New York and eventually became the head of the Physics and Chemistry Department and Vice President of that institution. In addition to teaching, Doremus played a role in the founding of the New York Medical College, the Long Island Hospital and Medical College and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College. Doremus died in 1906 at age 83. "
