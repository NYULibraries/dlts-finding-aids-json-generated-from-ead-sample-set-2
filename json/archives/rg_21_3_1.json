The purpose was to ascertain whether there was enough important material still unpublished relating to Albert Gallatin's life to justify a publication project.  The interest in Albert Gallatin arose for two reasons.  The first was his connection to the political, financial, and diplomatic history of the United Sates, from 1790 to 1849.  The second reason was his importance to the history of New York University.  He was one of the founders and was the first president of the Council of the University.  "
