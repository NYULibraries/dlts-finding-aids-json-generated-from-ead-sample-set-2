The majority of office files range in date from the 1920s to the mid-2000s. The 60th and 70th company anniversary material contains paper and electronic files, including invitation lists, planning memos, and dinner table assignments from 1996. Files and reports related to the company's mergers and sales throughout its history can also be found in this collection. A significant number of the company's print advertisements dating from the 1970s through the 1990s can be found in this collection in the form of proofs, samples, and original artwork. A mouse pad and pin with the company logo is included in this collection. John Herzog accumulated and used these office files while writing his 2017 book on the company's history, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003e A Billion to One,\u003c/span\u003e which was an expanded version of his 1966 Master's thesis.
