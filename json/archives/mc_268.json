Renwick's research files are followed by a number of general course files consisting of handouts, reading packets, and exercises, which are arranged in the collection by topic. In addition to these general files, the collection also contains specific course files that are arranged in chronological order by term. Courses include Foundations of Finance / Introduction to Finance; Financial Markets and Investments; Equity Instruments and Markets: Analysis, Predictability, Appraisal; Security Analysis; Investment Principles and Analysis; and Portfolio Analysis. Also included in the Renwick Papers are similar course materials generated by other Stern faculty members (both paper and electronic), as well as a file of student coursework."
