Materials include Renwick's 2015 \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/span\u003e obituary; resumes; documents about Renwick's honors, awards, and grants; conference materials; correspondence; as well as research files, some of which relate to Renwick's articles or his collaborative projects with other professors, including the chapters he wrote for \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eA Bibliography of Investments\u003c/span\u003e, which he co-authored with Malek K. Lashgari, Associate Professor of Finance at the University of Hartford, in 1990. Renwick's research files are followed by a number of general course files consisting of handouts, reading packets, and exercises, which are arranged in the collection by topic. In addition to these general files, the collection also contains specific course files that are arranged in chronological order by term. Courses include Foundations of Finance / Introduction to Finance; Financial Markets and Investments; Equity Instruments and Markets: Analysis, Predictability, Appraisal; Security Analysis; Investment Principles and Analysis; and Portfolio Analysis. Also included in the Renwick Papers are similar course materials generated by other Stern faculty members (both paper and electronic), as well as a file of student coursework."
