He received an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1947 and used his two consecutive Fulbright Awards (1949-1957) for research to earn a doctorate at Cambridge University in 1953 in medieval and modern languages. He began his academic career in 1953 when he was appointed an instructor of English at the University of California at Los Angeles. Two years later, UCLA appointed him assistant professor of English, a position he held until 1957, when he joined the faculty at Rutgers University. By 1960 Raymo attained a full professorship at Rutgers, leaving 4 years later (1964) to join the NYU English faculty at the Graduate School of Arts and Science.  In 1964 he also received the Lindback Foundation Award for Excellence and Distinguished Teaching and the Rutgers University Alumni Distinguished Teacher Award.  "
