Stoddard's affiliation with New York University began in 1953 when he was named Chairman of the Directing Committee of the University's $250,000 Self Study. This collection comprises documents that arose from Stoddard's affiliation with New York University. This collection will be of use to researchers interested in education reform and curriculum development and the recent history of NYU. There are a few items of particular note, such as draft copies of Stoddard's proposal for the Gallatin School and the University's Self Study, which Stoddard directed. Copies of Stoddard's Dual Progress Plan are included, along with a large volume of correspondence, notes, and literature relating to it. Also included is Stoddard's 1963 Mission of New York University, which was presented to the Ford Foundation as well as the text of a speech he delivered at NYU's 124th commencement ceremonies in 1956.",
