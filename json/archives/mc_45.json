In 1915 Hotchkiss established a Department of Advertising and Marketing at NYU, marking the first time in the school's history that \"advertising\" appeared in a department name.  He would serve as the department's chairman for 20 years.   Hotchkiss authored a number of widely known books on advertising and related subjects, including \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAdvertising Copy\u003c/span\u003e (1924), \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAn Outline of Advertising \u003c/span\u003e(1933), and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eMilestones of Marketing\u003c/span\u003e (1938).  Hotchkiss also co-authored many other advertising books, such as \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eAdvertising, Its Principles and Practice\u003c/span\u003e (1915). Hotchkiss served as president of the National Association of Teachers of Advertising in 1922, and as a member of many other organizations, including the American Marketing Association, Beta Gamma Sigma, Alpha Kappa Psi, the Author's Club (London), the Marshall Chess Club,  and  the Andiron Club (at NYU). In 1933 the NYU Chapter of Alpha Delta Sigma, a national advertising fraternity, named itself the \"George Burton Hotchkiss Chapter.\" Hotchkiss also received the Advertising and Selling Silver Medal Award for his distinguished service to advertising education in 1948.
