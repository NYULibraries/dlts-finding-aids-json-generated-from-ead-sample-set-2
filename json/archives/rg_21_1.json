His first course at New York University, entitled \"The American Vernacular as Symbolic Action,\" focused on the role played by the American vernacular language and style in shaping American culture and society. In the early 1970s the Chair sponsored a series of lectures for a national audience on \"Law and Morality,\" which was widely televised. Professor Ellison brought many poets to New York University for readings and conferences, and in 1977 he organized a panel discussion with eminent Yugoslavian scholars. Professor Ellison served as a consultant to students in creative writing, doctoral students, and served on oral examination committees.

This series contains a wide range of materials that pertain both to events and courses under the auspices of the Schweitzer Chair.

He shaped courses and lecture series to reflect his broad interests in politics, society, literature, and the humanities. Professor O'Brien's original organization remains with only a few alterations."
