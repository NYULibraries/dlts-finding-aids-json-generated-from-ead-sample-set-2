After graduating from Transylvania University in 1839 and considering entering the ministry, Sayre began to study medicine. He graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons (now part of Columbia University) in New York in 1842 and became a leading orthopedic surgeon of the 19th century. In 1859 he was appointed surgeon to the Bellevue Hospital and in 1861 was one of the principal founders of the Bellevue Hospital Medical College. Sayre served as professor of both orthopedic surgery and clinical surgery, and when the Bellevue Hospital Medical College merged with the University Medical College at NYU in 1898, Sayre was appointed emeritus professor of orthopedic and clinical surgery in the consolidated institution. In addition to his work as a professor and surgeon, Sayre was noted for his efforts to improve sanitary conditions in New York as well as his assistance in stopping the spread of cholera from sailors on ships entering New York City."
