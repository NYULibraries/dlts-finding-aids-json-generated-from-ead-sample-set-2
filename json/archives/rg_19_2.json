Anxiety grew with the revelations of the Alger Hiss case in 1948 and the trial of American Communist Party leaders in 1949. Universities came under scrutiny the same year, as state legislatures investigated subversive activity at the Universities of Michigan and Washington. At the latter, three professors were dismissed in 1951 for Communist affiliation."

The collegiate subculture established in other American universities in the nineteenth century, including the University Heights campus, was less evident in the urban campus, with its vocational focus, lack of playing fields and lack of dormitories; older veterans gave a serious and frequently political tone to student clubs and organizations at the Square. Organized student and political protests, however, lacked the national focus that characterized the student movement of 20 years later. It is significant the one of the charges brought against Bradley, that of holding a noisy, impetuous and potentially disorderly demonstration, was originally made by the head of the student government organization, and then adopted by the Dean of the College."

While the administration took pains to define the dismissal of Bradley for his actions and activities only, the financial constituency expected from the University a strong message to the nation and the academic community that NYU was determined to sever from its midst any element that promoted a philosophy unfriendly to the national interest."

Correspondence with other university presidents on academic freedom topics similar to this one suggests that this subject may be represented in the Chancellor's general correspondence files (Record Group 3.0.5). There is considerable discussion of tenure (Box 2, Folder 14) and communication with and from the Vice Chancellor (Box 3, Folder 2 - an intermingling of office files may have occurred). The question of moral turpitude that appears occasionally is a reference to the AAUP. Also illustrated are the persuasive powers of Voorhis in countering Dean Pollock's suggestion that a year's salary must be paid in the absence of a judgement of moral turpitude."

Cooley was the sole dissenting opinion in the Senate Committee and was the AAUP representative and author of the report on NYU which contributed to its censure. Academic freedom at NYU is highlighted in the reply of Dean Pollock to a suggestion by counsel that students report on Bradley's advocacy of Communism in the classroom. Checking on faculty in such a fashion was not a policy of New York University, and Pollock affirmed that it was action, not ideology, that was involved in Bradley's trial."

Their presence here explains their mention (but absence) from the files of their origin in Series I and II. Of interest is the note of the change of wording of one Council resolution to avoid the mention of moral turpitude. No explanation is given for the dissent of Mr. Hudson in protest of the implication, or for the action of Judge Vanderbilt, who disqualified himself from Council deliberations. Reference to full Council Meeting minutes reveal that while serious attention was always paid to the Bradley matter, it was one of many items considered of importance to University governance, and only in its initial and final stages was it granted more than a routine attention in deliberation."

These conditions along with the unique circumstances of this case provoked an examination of the privileges of academic freedom and the responsibility of tenure. This collection contains a consecutive record of hearings of faculty and University Council sitting in judgment of one of their own. The role of legal counsel is significant, and the consultation with attorneys outside the University attests to the complexity of the case. The University Council's stated role in the bylaws as the supreme governing body with the power to make appointments and removals is here manifest in its function as final arbiter of the faculty's conclusions."
