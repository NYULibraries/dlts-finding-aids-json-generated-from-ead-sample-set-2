Official records are included in bound volumes of manuscript documents. There is a resolution protesting the projected closing of the University's Academic Department in 1881. An invitation to honorary membership for Martin Van Buren, dated 1841, which President Van Buren accepted, is found in Box 1, folder 5. A letter of gift dated 1940 accompanies the badges (Box 1, folder 7) and gives biographical data about their owner, George R. Howe (ex 1868)."
