While at the University of California he was apparently influenced by the 11critic of drama and famed writer of college songs, Charles Mills Cayley,\" for whom Allen served as departmental reader. Amongst the early teaching positions he held were \u003cspan class=\"ead-occupation\"\u003eInstructor in English\u003c/span\u003e at the \u003cspan class=\"ead-corpname\"\u003eUniversity of Idaho\u003c/span\u003e, from 1905 to 1907, and Assistant Professor of English at the State College of Washington, from 1911 to 1913. \u003cspan class=\"ead-occupation\"\u003eProfessor\u003c/span\u003e Allen received his doctorate from\u003cspan class=\"ead-corpname\"\u003e Harvard University\u003c/span\u003e in 1913 and was awarded a Sheldon traveling fellowship by Harvard for 1913-1914. In 1914, Allen assumed the position of Assistant Professor of English at NYU and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1922. In 1924 he was made full professor and remained at NYU until his ailing health compelled him to stop teaching in April, 1934. Professor Allen died on March 11, 1935 in California. "

During his stay at the University, Allen also published several articles (see attached bibliography). The only interruptions in Allen's lengthy teaching career at NYU came in 1918-1919, 1925-1926 and 1928-1930. While on sabbatical during the academic year 1918-1919, Allen served as an Instructor at \u003cspan class=\"ead-corpname\"\u003eL'Ecole Militaire d'Artilerie\u003c/span\u003e, located in \u003cspan class=\"ead-geogname\"\u003eFontainbleau, France\u003c/span\u003e. He visited Europe frequently, since it was there that the materials in his field of research were primarily located. In 1925,d Allen was granted another leave, at which time he returned to Europe in hopes of determining the subject for the literary endeavor he intended to produce. The results of his search were successful and hence he returned to his teaching position at University Heights with a great deal of enthusiasm about writing his book, in which he hoped to give 1tan Account of taste--of what men in those spacious days of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries liked and disliked when they built their houses and decorated and furnished them and when they laid out their gardens. He soon found, however, that he was unable to devote as much time as he desired to this project) since he was obliged to continue a full teaching schedule at the University. In 1928 he requested a two-year leave of absence, which Chancellor \u003cspan class=\"ead-name\"\u003eElmer E. Brown\u003c/span\u003e granted unhesitatingly, and with the assurance that his teaching position would be held even for three years, if necessary. Professor Allen returned to Europe in the Fall of 1928, where he worked on his book, without the help of a grant or stipend from the University; his only source of revenue lay in his own savings and the income from a small legacy. In 1930, after he had accomplished a good deal of work on the book, he returned to the Heights and resumed his full teaching schedule. The book, which Allen entitled: \u003cspan class=\"ead-name\"\u003eTides in English Taste\u003c/span\u003e, was completed in 1931. This two volume book was intended as a background for the study of literature. "

Eventually the manuscript was sent to the\u003cspan class=\"ead-corpname\"\u003e Harvard University Press\u003c/span\u003e, where it remained unpublished for a year, also as a consequence of insufficient funds. It was not until after Allen became ill and returned to California in 1934 that he learned that the Harvard Press had accepted the manuscript. Shortly afterwards, printing was undertaken, but it was interrupted in March, 1935, upon Allen's untimely death. After the executors of Allen's estate dealt with the inevitable technicalities that arose, printing was resumed and the book was finally published in March, 1937, five years after it had been completed. The book is apparently autobiographical; moreover, the subject of the book is said to indicate the varied interests of the author.
